Make sure the butter is really soft and handle the pasty to soften the butter as much as possible. I pressed the base into a shallow based try and that meant I could tidy the edges and then I worked a tennis ball size of the pasty in my hands to warm it up and then put it on greaseproof paper, put another piece of greaseproof on top, pushed it down and then rolled it between the paper. Worked perfectly and I cut star shaped tops rather than cover them completely. With my oven, I cooked them for about 17 minutes and they come out perfectly. My other half said they were the best mince pies he’s ever had and his mum is a fantastic baker. Definitely worth making and really quick to make.',\n",

If you want to make marzipan before you are ready to cover your cake, then wrap it well in cling film and keep in a fridge for up to a week – as wrapped in a ball it will still contain a little moisture.

The cakey stollen mixture spreads out and sits neatly atop the mince pie bit which looks good. I have put chopped pistachios on top prior to the bake ... this works well ... or put dried cranberries and/or juicy yellow raisins in the cake mixture as well as marzipan but they will burn if you just put them on top. I have also put lemon zest on top of the blob of mincemeat .. also nice :)',\n",

Dip your finger in a little water and gently pat down any peaks on the top of the balls of dough. Place the 2 sheets in the oven and bake for 25-30 mins, swapping the trays over after 20 mins. The choux buns should be puffed up and crisp when cooked. Leave to cool completely.',\n",

Fed a party of 25 people well as part of a buffet and had the added bonus for us of also happening to be naturally dairy free. I don't have a meat thermometer so I tested whether it was cooked using the spoon method the recipe suggests and it worked perfectly. I also was worried that I couldn't fit all that much stock into the pie but I need not have worried as it came out with lots of jelly. My pie did spring a bit of a leak but I patched that with a bit of spare pastry I had until it was cool, when the jelly had set and it no longer leaked. I also made the cranberry topping which was simple, although I did get lots of juice left. But no matter; seeing as the juice was just a mix of sugar, cranberry and sherry I used it to make Christmas cocktails by mixing it with gin and soda water!\",\n",

If you want to make marzipan before you are ready to cover your cake, then wrap it well in cling film and keep in a fridge for up to a week – as wrapped in a ball it will still contain a little moisture. As it contains raw eggs it shouldn’t be given to anyone in an at-risk group, including pregnant women, the elderly, the unwell and the very young.

       "  'Method': ['ICE THE CAKE: Melt the apricot jam, then sieve and brush a little all over a 23cm cake (see Apricot & almond fruitcake recipe to the right of this recipe). On a clean surface lightly dusted with a little sifted icing sugar, roll out the marzipan to a circle large enough to cover the cake – use a piece of kitchen string to help you check.

It should be long enough to go round the cake – use a piece of kitchen string to help you measure it. Use a rolling pin to roll the sausage into a strip about 5cm wide. Use a small, sharp knife to straighten one edge, and trim the other into a wiggly edge.',\n",
       "   'Keep all the trimmings, and squash half into 2 wobbly circles for the snowmen to sit on. Brush the strip, circles and the very bottom edge of the cake with a little runny icing made with 100g sifted icing sugar and a splash of water. Scatter the desiccated coconut over the strip and circles, gently pressing to stick and cover. Starting with one end of the strip, stick it round the base of the cake. This can be a bit fiddly, so if you’re nervous, simply halve the icing from the start and do in 2 half-length strips, using a little more coconut to hide the joins on the cake.',\n",
       "   'SHAPE THE SNOWMEN: Roll the remaining third of regal icing into 2 large balls, 2 medium balls and 2 small balls. Stick together, squashing slightly, into 2 snowmen. Brush 4 cocktail sticks with a little brown food colouring and stick into the snowmen for arms.',\n",
       "   'ADD BUTTONS AND NOSES: Push a few whole cloves into one snowman as buttons. Use a little orange food colouring to dye a little of the strip trimmings, and shape a little around the pointy end of 2 cloves to look like carrot noses. Use another clove to make little holes where the noses will go, dab a bit of runny icing into the holes and stick on the noses, pushing them into the holes to help hold them.',\n",
       "   'SMILEY FACES: Use a black or brown writing icing pen to dot on smiley mouths and eyes – I find it helps to mark tiny holes with the end of a cocktail stick first. It stops you making mistakes and helps the icing stay in place.',\n",
       "   'MAKE THE HAT: Dye another lump of regal icing trimmings with food colouring (we used green). Shape most into a woolly hat shape, pressing a slight dip into the bottom with your thumb where it will sit on the snowman’s head. Roll a little ball to stick on top of the hat; attach it with more runny icing. Then roll and cut a thin strip to stick round the base of the hat. Use a cocktail stick to make markings like a woolly hat and rough up the ball on top. A little more runny icing will help it stick onto your snowman’s head.',\n",
       "   'AND LASTLY, THE SCARF: Knot the strawberry laces together at one end. Tightly plait a 10cm length and knot at the end again. Using scissors, snip the ends, leaving about 1cm for tassels after the knot, then wrap around the neck of the other snowman. Sit the wobbly snowy islands on top of the cake and a snowman on each one.']},\n",

Bring the water to the boil and simmer gently for about 15 mins until the potatoes are cooked all the way through but not on the brink of collapse.

One at a time and working methodically (starting at one corner of the roasting tin and lining them up as you go) place each potato in the oil and use a spoon to turn it so it’s completely coated. Don’t worry about the oil cooling down too much. Once all the potatoes are in the tin in a single layer, not touching, place the tin in the oven and cook for 40 mins, undisturbed.',\n",

Also used left over gravy to boost the chicken stock. Added in the turkey wrapped bacon.

Snuggle in as many flat as you can, then sit your overlapping ones on top, cutting out bits of the squash, so they’ll also sit flat too.
