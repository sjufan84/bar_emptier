      "page_content=\"hey nerds farmer Jesse here so it's one thing to grow vegetables in an entirely other thing to get them ready for market so in today's video we're going to go over the keys to a good wash pack station sometimes called a pack house sometimes called a wash head sometimes called wash Vegas nearly 8 billion people in the world somebody calls it wash Vegas no matter the name there are some key elements each wash station should possess and some that may not be as necessary and at the end of this video I will take two crops from field to Market so you can see what that process roughly looks like per usual I'll share some of our mistakes uh our deficiencies as they pertain to washing and packing so let's do it foreign there are very few crops on our farm that come out of the field just ready for Market most produce need some amount of washing wiping packing cooling uh maybe just one of the above but maybe all of them the goal however is not to spend more time on this task than you absolutely have to getting it from the field to your customers with as few steps in between as possible should always be the goal not just for profitability but the more you handle a crop the more risk you run of damaging said crop or increasing foodborne pathogen exposure so designing a good wash pack station is key to running an efficient and safe produce operation now I am a fan of contextual caveats because I like to make sure it's understood that there are many ways to do basically anything in farming and I look forward to reading in the comments section how you set up your watchback station or wood or how it would differ for us this is the setup that has worked on our One acre-ish Market Garden but I'll also discuss some things that I would like to change your approach may be very different or you may scale it down for your home so you can just get all the soil off of your crops before you bring them into kitchen so you're not doing it in the kitchen sink not always

individually those of you who've been watching this channel for a while know about this tool already this is our foot operated root washer it's still a little prototypish but essentially we have our hands freed up to wash and clean things like carrots and beets green onions Etc while we operate the water with foot pressure I cannot emphasize enough how much faster this has made the entire process of cleaning root vegetables a little wetter to be sure but faster than our previous system of laying the carrots out on a table and washing them individually because you can be grabbing the next Bunch or pulling out a weed or a dead leaf at the same time as you are spraying where two seasons into using it and it's been wildly helpful a couple changes I would recommend or that we have made or will make first I think it would be nice to also have a hose permanently placed in this area for bin washing because it's not super convenient to drag the hose over there or wash bins under the foot pedal washer second it's nice to have it extended out six or ten inches so you're not bending unlike our first prototype third having it under a roof for rainy days is a good idea but also for shade as the veggies get stacked there for a while like while we're harvesting speaking of that I want to expand the staging area out more like where we stack them because it definitely gets crowded to the left of the sprayer before we start moving stuff down the line next we added a water collection bucket which is uh insufficient because it fills up so fast so we're going to install a barrel with the hose that drains right into a old pile for later use so we don't lose that soil we spray off and of course the water and because it kind of makes a Mucky mess just sitting there below our feet I mentioned washing bins and that's a huge time\" metadata={'source': 'JYQyovXIqGU', 'text': \"hey nerds farmer Jesse here so it's one thing to grow vegetables in an entirely other thing to get them ready for market so in today's video we're going to go over the keys to a good wash pack station sometimes called a pack house sometimes called a wash head sometimes called wash Vegas nearly 8 billion people in the world somebody calls it wash Vegas no matter the name there are some key elements each wash station should possess and some that may not be as necessary and at the end of this video I will take two crops from field to Market so you can see what that process roughly looks like per usual I'll share some of our mistakes uh our deficiencies as they pertain to washing and packing so let's do it foreign there are very few crops on our farm that come out of the field just ready for Market most produce need some amount of washing wiping packing cooling uh maybe just one of the above but maybe all of them the goal however is not to spend more time on this task than you absolutely have to getting it from the field to your customers with as few steps in between as possible should always be the goal not just for profitability but the more you handle a crop the more risk you run of damaging said crop or increasing foodborne pathogen exposure so designing a good wash pack station is key to

stick together forming the world's strongest bonds second only to two five gallon buckets that's got to be the strongest so you need space enough to either hang or stack the bends separately also in terms of Bin choices definitely do not follow my lead here and just standardize your bins if you can it all afford it buy airtight stackable bins preferably with the lids attached that are food grade and easy to wash I will put a link in the show notes to the work that the University of Vermont extension AG engineering has done exploring different Harvest container options that is really helpful the reason we have all the these different bins is because we wanted to save some money and then we couldn't find the identical bins when we needed to buy new ones so now we have like five different types of bins not ideal we got our yellow Harvest bins from a very random Amish store but I'll also put a few links in the show notes where to find similar bins also bulb crates that flower bulbs come in those make fine bins if you are or if you know of any flower farmers who maybe don't need them anyway like I said I'll take a couple crops from start to finish at the end of this video so moving on into the building it's good to have a covered area for greens washing so that one it's easy to wash and two so that it's out of the rain but more so the sun and the wind and snow and whatever else wants to destroy your Harvest we lucked out finding a property with this building on it but when we first started out farming on a different property I built a small lean to where we would wash everything which was fine too as long as it was out of the rain in the Sun a garage can work a carport it's possible to watch under a large tree or something but the food safety can get a little iffy there with I don't know Birds above you and to be clear food safety is absolutely Paramount if you're selling food you want this area to be easy to clean and sanitized because you do not want to make anyone sick I'll link a couple organically approved products in the show notes that are not well bleach so yes we invested uh pretty hard in stainless steel for this area for the sanitation element of it it's just easy to clean that is not a requisite but it's nice to have a few easily cleanable tables as well as three base sink to wash and pack now of course that's not necessary you could easily use nice food grade large buckets you can always improve that spot later for the sink nothing special here we like having multiple sinks because sometimes lettuce is dirty or it has bugs in it and just needs a second dunk to ensure the bugs don't make it to the bagging table being an organic farm who doesn't even use the approved sprays bugs are a real challenge for us but not so much pests generally things like spiders and ladybugs and lightning bugs are always hiding out in our lettuce and so having a second dunking albeit slowing down the process can help to get some of those out we also have a pool strainer is that what these things are called pool strainers to remove debris from the surface of the water if something is really buggy you can use a very clean bin to weigh the lettuce down or the grain below the water and then use the pool strainer to help clean off the floating bugs and such next we have the salad spinner which is a converted washing machine we you've had

      "page_content=\"hey nerds farmer Jesse here so today let's talk about starting a farm but this is not your average video where I just say get some land and plant some seeds rather this is the nitty-gritty whether you're starting from scratch or leveling up your homestead or just wondering what the heck a farm would take to start this video is going to give you the guidance you need to make that jump properly so let's do it [Music] okay so obviously starting a small farm is no small task Farms are these incredibly Dynamic entities unlike almost any other business where you are not just the manufacturer in many cases but also the distributor the marketing department HR the guy with the bad jokes of the water cooler all of it and so because the farm business is so complex my first step to starting a farm is wildly important and it may even lead some of you immediately down to the comment section to voice your objections but hold on first I want to give a shout out to today's video sponsor BCS America BCS two-wheeled tractors power dozens of PTO driven attachments and they're built with gear driven Transmissions that come with a lifetime warranty I mean flail mowers power Heroes snow blowers chippers and more not only has BCS been a long time supporter of no-till Growers but I Rely heavily on a BCS 749 for innumerable tasks on my farm we bought our BCS in 2014 and it has been without question one of the best farm Investments to date learn more at bcsamerica.com okay so back to that wildly important suggestion that I want to make off the top and hear me out the very first step to starting a farm is not buying land indeed purchasing land may be the last step or may not be a step at all honestly of course if you're inheriting land or you have land to use or you've already purchased land then that's fine you can move on to the next step but for prospective Farm business owners though know that land ownership can Gravely complicate starting a successful

because if you do not pay attention to what\" metadata={'source': 'heTxEsrPVdQ', 'text': \"hey nerds farmer Jesse here so today let's talk about starting a farm but this is not your average video where I just say get some land and plant some seeds rather this is the nitty-gritty whether you're starting from scratch or leveling up your homestead or just wondering what the heck a farm would take to start this video is going to give you the guidance you need to make that jump properly so let's do it [Music] okay so obviously starting a small farm is no small task Farms are these incredibly Dynamic entities unlike almost any other business where you are not just the manufacturer in many cases but also the distributor the marketing department HR the guy with the bad jokes of the water cooler all of it and so because the farm business is so complex my first step to starting a farm is wildly important and it may even lead some of you immediately down to the comment section to voice your objections but hold on first I want to give a shout out to today's video sponsor BCS America BCS two-wheeled tractors power dozens of PTO driven attachments and they're built with gear driven Transmissions that come with a lifetime warranty I mean flail mowers power Heroes snow blowers chippers and more not only has BCS been a long time supporter of no-till Growers but I Rely heavily on a BCS 749 for innumerable tasks on my farm we bought our BCS in 2014 and it has been without question one of the best farm Investments to date learn more at bcsamerica.com okay so back to that wildly important suggestion that I want to make off the top and hear me out the very first step to starting a farm is not buying land indeed purchasing land may be the last step or may not be a step at all honestly of course if you're inheriting land or you have land to use or you've already purchased land then that's fine you can move on to the next step but for prospective Farm business owners though know that land ownership can Gravely complicate starting a successful business like when you go to start a restaurant or a dance studio or a soccer themed karaoke bar I am allowed to have dreams you

which outline how much the farm needs to earn again there are a thousand ways to start a business this is just my Approach and a little of what I'd wish I'd known when we started for the farm budget uh the basic idea here is that like your family budget you want to get the best numbers you can for what it will cost you to run a farm for the first year and then for an average year this assumes of course you know what kind of farming you want to embark on but in the buildup phase which can take anywhere from one to ten years depending on your startup capital and experience and what kind of farm you're trying to start don't expect to get the budget fully right you have to work on it every year just be as thorough as you can in estimating these numbers now for the business plan there are plenty of templates online and some get into extreme detail which is great but unless you're going to be using this plan to apply for a loan or a grant the first draft of the business plan is just for you it's goal setting it's to see what you hope to do written out the business plan does not have to be an intense document in fact I suggest one-page Max to start even something like this though these numbers are somewhat arbitrary and that's a good start that's good enough to see if what you want to do will cover your farm budget and what percentage of it will cover your family budget as well do the numbers work they may not which is fine at first you may just have to increase income I.E production or prices or services or whatever more than you expected or maybe raise some additional startup capital or expect to find some supplemental farm income just as you build which brings us to The Next Step create a startup budget and raise some dang startup Capital so you will need to get a

at the end of this video I'll give you my latest cover crop fail or pseudo fail anyway you'll see so let's do it we learn more from our mistakes than our successes right or at least hopefully they do I I don't seem to learn anything oh before we get into strategies let's briefly discuss what I'm talking about when I'm talking about cover crops uh cover crops are plants that you grow for a period of time with no real intention of harvesting them now there are some caveats to that to not harvesting them which we'll discuss but generally you are growing the cover crop simply to replenish the

and four how are you going to establish the cover crop you choose so let's go through each of those first up defining your cover crop goals determining what you want out of your cover crop is the first step to determining what the cover crop is going to be cover crops can do a lot of different things for soil say your soil is compacted the right cover crops can help break up compaction layers or maybe your soil is deplete in certain nutrients or soil organic matter cover crops can help replenish those too that said if your goal is for the cover crop to help mulch you may have to be more strategic than if your goal is simply to have the cover crop add some nitrogen through a legume like field piece which are good for nitrogen fixation but don't themselves make a good long-term mulch at least not on their own because they're just very tender so let's get an overview of each goal and how to navigate it the basic cover cropping rule for compaction is to use cover crops with deep tap Roots such as brassicas like rapeseed which no one feels comfortable saying I have no idea why that continues Brassica nap is nap seed everybody loves naps problem solved anyway for decompaction focus on crops like napseed daikon or tillage radish mustards and brassicas like that both the large and fine roots of these crops can dig deep into the soil and help decompact the soil as they grow and then decompose for nitrogen fixation using leguminous crops like peas beans batch annual clovers and so on which are often inoculated with rhizobium bacteria which you purchase separately is the way to go if the goal is a mulch then grasses like rye wheat barley oats that sort of stuff plus like sorghum Sudan grass and other grain types are going to give you the best above ground biomass as well

our mistakes than our successes right or at least hopefully they do I I don't seem to learn anything oh before we get into strategies let's briefly discuss what I'm talking about when I'm talking about cover crops uh cover crops are plants that you grow for a period of time with no real intention of harvesting them now there are some caveats to that to not harvesting them which we'll discuss

brassicacious seed meal instead to do that same have that same effect if you're going to work it in and of course blends of different crop species can not only increase biodiversity within the soil but sometimes yield of the subsequent crop According to some studies and check the notes for some citations on all of this stuff so what I usually recommend is to focus the majority of your cover crop on your primary goal and add a few other crops that make sense in terms of your termination strategy for soil health and microbial diversity before we get into termination though we have to talk about question number two what is your desired crop that you want to plant following the cover crop if you want to follow your cover crop with say like carrots or something you have to directly seed a multi-cover crop like Rye may not be the best idea because even after it's terminated it will be challenging to sew anything into it you may instead want something that does not create a heavy mulch such as legumes and other you know broad leaf plants that will either break down or can just be lightly raked off the surface before you sew if you want to transplant thousands of lettuce plants you may make the same sort of decision because transplanting into a thick mulch is a lot of work on a small scale fine on a large scale it's a lot of work if you're following a cover crop with something like tomatoes though as we often do then a mulching cover crop might be I ideal you might want that extra weed suppression even if it means digging the holes for the Tomato transplants requires a little extra work pulling that mulch aside and then digging hole crop planting is perhaps beyond the scope of this particular video but one of the biggest mistakes I see in cover cropping is when someone writes me in March or April freaking out that they are ready to plant their crop but they're Rye or you know whatever cover crop it is is still very short and not ready to be terminated that

into a cover crop like that it would be tough to do so without tillage as early as other people in the area usually plant their first field tomatoes around the first of May our cover crop's just not quite ready at that point so of course make sure you consider those things but anyway back to the killing of the cover crop on a small scale you have a lot of no-till options for one you can smash the

sow buckwheat at the same time as other summer cover crops I either use it Solo or with something like mung beans which grow fairly fast or I sew it in a week later after I've sewed my original cover crop so if I sew sorghum Sudan grass I'll wait a week and then sew my buckwheat because buckwheat will just outrun everything lastly for the quick hitters I will mix in vegetable seeds sometimes but

      "page_content=\"[Music] thank you [Music] hey nerds farmer Jesse here so today we're going to discuss regenerative agriculture in the garden or in the Market Garden because I feel like this concept of regenerative agriculture is often relegated to or at least primarily associated with larger scales and it's not always clear what it looks like on a small scale so let's go for it is that what I usually say I feel like I have a different catchphrase something about meddling kids that'll come to me [Music] okay so in order to talk about what regenerative agriculture looks like on a smaller scale we kind of have to start with what the heck regenerative agriculture is to begin with and the good news is that everyone seems to use a slightly different definition so I'm going to dig in a little bit into the definition for a minute so if you're like meh and you just want the practices you can skip to this time here for the rest of you nerds let's dive into this regenerative agriculture term for a minute uh in fact one of the more fun elements of researching this particular video was realizing that even more so than the term no-till the term regenerative agriculture is just a swirling living breathing bundle of principles more than it is a single term and no two people seem to Define it exactly the same way in a nutshell regenerative means to utilize practices that promote soil health and utilize the regenerative properties of soil IE the soil's ability to improve or repair itself but as this really fascinating 2020 review of 229 Journal articles and 25 practitioner websites discovered that can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people so that said by and large most papers and practitioners agree on what regenerative looks like reducing tillage using cover crops and crop rotations incorporating perennials and livestock Etc and what the outcomes are things like improving ecosystems soil health and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and so on now I should say that I do not use the term regenerative very much or very often to describe my own practices or the practices that we really promote here at no-till Growers because well no-till and living soil pretty much sums up what we talk about but like those terms regenerative agriculture looks at how soil functions and attempts to engage with the science behind it

four principles for living soil I've talked about these principles in this series here and all over this channel but they are effectively keep the soil covered as much as possible keep it planted and planted diversely as much as possible disturb it as little as you possibly can and use a diversity of Life promoting inputs such as compost compost teas animals if you can Korean natural farming and or just Dom preparations and so on so let's go through each principle and what they each look like on our farm currently and how they they relate to regenerating soil in general especially on a small scale first keep the soil covered as much as possible this principle is really about mulches and residues the idea here is simply to keep the soil armored against rain wind Dogma sunlight and whatever else might endanger it and I'm not going to go through every mulch because that's what this video here was for but the value of mulches cannot really be overstated especially those that the soil can

regenerative agriculture in the garden or in the Market Garden because I feel like this concept of regenerative agriculture is often relegated to or at least primarily associated with larger scales and it's not always clear what it looks like on a small scale so let's go for it is that what I usually say I feel like I have a different catchphrase something about meddling kids that'll come to me [Music] okay so in order to talk about what regenerative agriculture looks like on a smaller scale we kind of have to start with what the heck regenerative agriculture is to begin with and the good news is that everyone seems to use a slightly different definition so I'm going to dig in a little bit into the definition for a minute so if you're like meh and you just want the practices you can skip to this time here for the rest of you nerds let's dive into this regenerative agriculture term for a minute uh in fact one of the more fun elements of researching this particular video was realizing that even more so than the term no-till the term regenerative agriculture is just a swirling living breathing bundle of principles more than it is a single term and no two people seem to Define it exactly the same way in a nutshell regenerative means to utilize practices that promote soil health and utilize the regenerative properties of soil IE the soil's ability to improve or repair itself but as this really fascinating 2020 review of 229 Journal articles and 25 practitioner websites discovered that can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people so that said by and large most papers and practitioners agree on what regenerative looks like reducing tillage using cover crops and crop rotations incorporating perennials and livestock Etc and what the outcomes are things like improving ecosystems soil health and biodiversity and carbon sequestration and so on now I should say that I do not use the term regenerative very much or very often to describe my own practices or the practices that we really promote here at no-till Growers because well no-till and living soil pretty much sums up what we talk about but like those terms regenerative agriculture looks at how soil functions and attempts to engage with the science behind it in a given context and moreover regenerative agriculture is not usually just like repackaging indigenous practices and

so take that principle number two keep the soil planted as much as possible no Amendment no mulch no amount of Shameless begging will ever repair and replenish the soil quite like plants will the reason for this is that plants are the ecological liaison between carbon dioxide and soil organic matter that is to say plants convert to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that stuff you and I and a bunch of other macro and micro creatures breathe out into carbonaceous things like plant roots and leaves and fruits as well as Tiny sugary cocktails that they feed the microbes through the soil

the plants live and die and get eaten and become a part of bigger and bigger organisms more organic matter is deposited into the soil and into the environment which means more water holding capacity more habitat for microbes more nutrients and more life and diversity so yeah yeah but what does that look like in practice well first it looks like plants lots of them in the ground in the soil year round absolutely as much as possible this can be crops it can be cover crops it can be living Pathways it can be perennials it can be hedges in ecological areas but it needs to be one as diversely planted as humanly possible so not just like an acre of okra because there's no diversity there and honestly that just makes me itch thinking about it and two it needs to fit your climate if you have snowpack all winter I don't expect you to have a green growing crop in the gardens in January if you can get a cover crop down great but obviously context is everything in farming and so if you're on a very small scale and can't take space out for a cover crop I get it having a crop growing is better than nothing so just whatever you can get in the ground and what one important note on the need for diversity every plant brings different qualities to the soil from the amount of biomass it produces above and below ground to the depths of its root systems to the specific microbial populations they cultivate in and around their roots and leaves even the pollinators and bugs they attract or repel are going to have an effect on the garden at large and the greater the level of diversity as it

      "page_content=\"[Music] hey nerds farmer Jesse here today we are going to take a tour through our farm and dissect some of the different pieces and parts from the wash pack station to the soccer field and the hedges and everything in between and stay tuned for the very end where I'll show you a cool outdoor Verma compost setup I came across when I was at Manokin Farm in North Dakota recently you know for Goofs so let's do it still fighting the laryngitis you know highly overrated honestly [Music] alright so although you will rarely find two Farms that look entirely alike or maybe even anything alike all Market garden farms have largely the same components uh you need a place to store tools you need a place to grow food you may want a place to propagate plants especially if you're selling food you will need a place to wash and pack it plus some sort of place to keep the food and then there are some additional elements like composting and ecological areas and so on that I'll suggest later in the video with each of these elements I'm going to talk a little bit about location and design and some things I would do differently but obviously designing a garden is an enormous topic of conversation so if that's something you need more insight on I do discuss that a little bit in the living soil handbook which you can get from notelgros.com to help support these videos cool so our farm is roughly one acre that we have to manage including Mowing and such with about half an acre in bed tops bed tops just meaning the actual growing space we do not use every bit of that growing space either some of it is just on hand in case we decide to boost production or need some emergency beds for vegetables for vegetable emergencies that's probably a thing we divided our Gardens into two main systems on this side we have the high rotation crops that would be lettuces arugula carrots green onions beets squashes those sorts of things these are crops that are generally under 60 days to maturity the idea here is that these are the beds we visit the most so we want those closest to the WASP pack station which is here then the other half of our garden is what we call the slow rotation plots the slow rotation plots are where we grow things like potatoes sweet potatoes winter squash popcorn in other longer season crops so whereas the high rotation plots might receive four or five crops per bed per year the slow rotation plots are generally only seen one maybe two crops per year most of the fertility in those plots is managed with a combination of cover crops and hay the hay being another reason we cannot grow a lot of high rotation crops out there the weed seeds make direct sowing pretty much impossible and when there is a lot of hay down it's really difficult to transplant say thousands of lettuce transplants into it the slow rotation plots you can see are further away from the wash pack because they usually just require one big planting one big harvesting you can see most of the slow rotation plots are pointed downhill as well we have a slight slope here and that downhill bed thing is simply because our farm does not drain basically at all we learned that lesson quickly in the high rotation plots where I originally cut them slightly across the field to help capture water but we kind of just found that that just led to erosion in

dissect some of the different pieces and parts from the wash pack station to the soccer field and the hedges and everything in between and stay tuned for the very end where I'll show you a cool outdoor Verma compost setup I came across when I was at Manokin Farm in North Dakota recently you know for Goofs so let's do it still fighting the laryngitis you know highly overrated honestly [Music] alright so although you will rarely find two Farms that look entirely alike or maybe even anything alike all Market garden farms have largely the same components uh you need a place to store tools you need a place to grow food you may want a place to propagate plants especially if you're selling food you will need a place to wash and pack it plus some sort of place to keep the food and then there are some additional elements like composting and ecological areas and so on that I'll suggest later in the video with each of these elements I'm going to talk a little bit about location and design and some things I would do differently but obviously designing a garden is an enormous topic of conversation so if that's something you need more insight on I do discuss that a little bit in the living soil handbook which you can get from notelgros.com to help support these videos cool so our farm is roughly one acre that we have to manage including Mowing and such with about half an acre in bed tops bed tops just meaning the actual growing space we do not use every bit of that growing space either some of it is just on hand in case we decide to boost production or need some emergency beds for vegetables for vegetable emergencies that's probably a thing we divided our Gardens into two main systems on this side we have the high rotation crops that would be lettuces arugula carrots green onions beets squashes those sorts of things these are crops that are generally under 60 days to maturity the idea here is that these are the beds we visit the most so we want those closest to the WASP pack station which is here then the other half of our garden is what we call the slow rotation plots the slow rotation plots are where we grow things like potatoes sweet potatoes winter squash popcorn in other longer season crops so whereas the high rotation plots might receive four or five crops per bed per year the slow rotation plots are generally only seen one maybe two crops per year most of the fertility in those plots is managed with a combination of cover crops and hay the hay being another reason we cannot grow a lot of high rotation crops out there the weed seeds make direct sowing pretty much impossible and when there is a lot of hay down it's really difficult to transplant say thousands of lettuce transplants into it the slow rotation plots you can see are further away from the wash pack because they usually just require one big planting one big harvesting you can see most of the slow rotation plots are pointed downhill as well we have a slight slope here and that downhill bed thing is simply because our farm does not drain basically at all we learned that lesson quickly in the high rotation plots where I originally cut them slightly across the field to help capture water but we kind of just found that that just led to erosion in certain spots because there were low spots all across the slope which is fun every context will be different of course but I now believe High rainfall areas we get about 50 inches per year give or take facing beds downhill or at least primarily downhill is the wiser choice to help release that water even if it

instead of Leaning slightly downhill because they are just not releasing the water adequately which means that we're losing some soil in some areas our Pathways in the high rotation plots are living which helps reduce erosion and for more on living Pathways you can watch this video here because living pathways are a highly contextual decision and they take a lot of thought and forethought and

frequent visits in the winter time because you don't want to walk all the way across your farm and or any further than you absolutely have to when it's cold and we made sure to put it on a flatter section of our farm ideally your tunnels are on level ground to ensure they get even watering but I've had tunnels on various amounts of slopes that have done just fine it just takes some consideration in terms of water management If You Can level the ground first though that's ideal even with a little added compaction that leveling will contribute and you will have to work through for a couple years the level ground will be beneficial in the long run our tunnel is a 22 by 96 North Point Rimmel greenhouse and it does have the ridge vent which is nice in the summer because it releases the Heat and the whole thing basically turns into a giant shade house which is awesome another thing we like to keep keep close to our home is our Greenhouse or propagation house ideally it's close to the house for frequent watering we water about once an hour and management in the spring is just very intensive but we want it not too far from the gardens as well so transporting the seedlings isn't more of a chore than it already is I did this video here about our super basic Greenhouse but for our scale about less than one acre in production our 30 foot by 15 foot Greenhouse is mostly sufficient in case you're wondering how big it needs to be another important thing for us is our mulch piling areas we have two outside of the garden where larger trucks can dump wood chip or Etc and I don't know what Etc would be it's mostly just wood chips here I wish they would just randomly have compost they would dump off that would be nice and then we have two areas inside the garden as well and those are more like composting areas one is next to the washback station where we can dump clippings from you know lettuces and any sort of spare vegetable Parts I don't know if that's how you'd say it uh the other one is on the other side of the greenhouse where our static aerated compost system is and catches most of our garden scraps as well like if we're clearing a bed we just take all that to this pile and then we pile that up and once it gets big enough we start doing the static aerated composting a lot of folks have asked for updates on the static aerated composting pile

time each week we talk about something we do in agriculture and if you're not a farmer we just basically want to relate that to you why we do that and maybe like in today's example is this something that's safe so what we're talking about today is our plant growth hormone safe because you hear a lot about animal growth hormones and oh you don't want the hormones or anything like that in your livestock well with plant growth hormones is that going to hurt anything oh that's an interesting conversation when we think about plants they do have different hormones that they produce naturally in the root system and they move throughout the plant when you think about that root system there's a lot of auxins that are developed in the plant to make that root system grow bigger faster and this is a spot where Farmers have seen some nice gains especially when conditions aren't great out in the field to help that plant by giving it some more of those auxins so it can establish a good root system to bring in nutrients and water so just as an example of that this is a herbicide that we use it's dicamba or even for that matter 24d those are synthetic auxins they're in the way that our dad used to describe it to us is these products are trying to grow the plant to death so it's basically getting more oxen out there granted it's a synthetic one but it's a reproduction of what that plant was already naturally going to produce all we're trying to do is overload it to actually cause harm to the weed but yet there's not so much that it's going to cause any harm at all and you're never even going to know the treatment was done a few months later in your crop all right another hormone to think about is gibberellic acid and this is one that a lot of folks would realize is going on out in their yard once they know what it is gibberellic acid helps stem elongation when it warms up in the spring all of a sudden there's more gibberellic acid getting moved through the a plant and we see more stem elongation and we have to mow our lawn twice a week but when it's really cool we don't have to mow the lawn maybe once a week maybe not even at all for a while well farmers can put more gibberellic acid on crops to try to get that grass to grow a little bit faster and we see this being used even in organic beef production to try and get pasture grasses to grow faster in the spring so they can get those cattle out grazing on the pasture sooner or they can put it out in the fall as temperatures start to cool down and grass production is going down they can actually put gibberellic acid out in the fall and keep their cattle grazing on pastures to produce that grass-fed beef so is it possible that some plant growth hormones could be bad well it's possible but I will just tell you the ones we're using on our farm and the ones most farmers are using they've been out for years and years and years they've been proven to be very very safe so it's nothing to get that alarmed about what it does is it increases production if we use these things right and then hopefully it means a little more bottom line for the farmer as well well one thing that adds more bottom line and more

to mow the lawn maybe once a week maybe not even at all for a while well farmers can put more gibberellic acid on crops to try to get that grass to grow a little bit faster and we see this being used even in organic beef production to try and get pasture grasses to grow faster in the spring so they can get those cattle out grazing on the pasture sooner or they can put it out in the fall as temperatures start to cool down and grass production is going down they can actually put gibberellic acid out in the fall and keep their cattle grazing on pastures to produce that grass-fed beef so is it possible that some plant growth hormones could be bad well it's possible but I will just tell you the ones we're using on our farm and the ones most farmers are using they've been out for years and years and years they've been proven to be very very safe so it's nothing to get that alarmed about what it does is it increases production if we use these things right and then hopefully it means a little more bottom line for the farmer as well well one thing that adds more bottom line and more crop is controlling our weed of the week can you identify this week's weed [Music]\"}\n",

for the AG PhD field day it's always the last Thursday in July so this year that's July 27th it's a free event we host on our farm each year to say thank you to you for watching us here on AG PhD well it's great to be out in the middle of the field right in the center of the Season you can see all the crops in their glory and you can see a lot of our trails in the field with great weather it's a lot like today Brian well highs low low 80s okay I don't know when Darren got to be a meteorologist that knows the weather two months in advance but I don't want to jinx it but so let's normally it's pretty good but here's the thing with the weather normally we are only at that time of the year with a high of about 85 Degrees lows down in the low 60s so that's why we start at 7 00 a.m on that day so we catch some of that nice cool weather and we do Wrap Up by 4 pm so it's just a one day event the reason why it's a one-day event is we bring in a lot of great Farmers from around the world to talk to you about raising better crops and then quite frankly even for us it's uh it's an exhausting day because we are putting every possible effort we can into making this the best show you've ever been to so we've got a lot of great educational things both the plots that Darren was talking about and then a lot of these great guest speakers as well okay and if you're thinking this is the corn and soybean show you're wrong we're going to have at least a dozen different crops there to look at with new herbicides new fertilizer type techniques and products Naturals and many of the crops it's really exciting no matter what kind of crop you raise on your farm so during the morning we are going to take you through all our plots and just show you all the different things we've got going on we've got free food we've got free drinks all throughout the day got a lot of entertainment and also bring the family too we've got a kids area we've got a lot of special guest speakers that maybe if you aren't necessarily farm farm farm all the time you want to hear about some other things got some of that for you as well so it's going to be a great fun event all day well we've got a lot of plots to walk through a lot of equipment to see and yes you could do a lot of walking you also have plenty of places to sit down inside if you would like we've got air-conditioned buildings and we've got a lot of great speakers that will be there so we've got a number of different offerings throughout the day and like Brian said it's really designed to be for everyone so each year over the last few years we've had over 10 000 attendees we would love for you to join us as well this year again it's the free AG PhD field day it's our way to say thanks to you for watching us here in ag PhD TV always

      "page_content=\"AG PhD full episodes and more are now available on Acres TV the newest AG platform connecting you to fields of information look for us on watchacstv.com during our farm Basics time today we're going to talk a little about corn maturities as we get late here in May or early June we start thinking about should we as Farmers switch maturities we want to explain that to you just a little bit today and the things we look for in our own Farm we definitely get a lot of questions from non-farmers how do farmers pick maturity in corn because we hear people talk about 115 day corn and then we hear people talk about 85 day corn what's the big difference yeah so it's really how long is it going to take to mature so let's say at 115 day corn versus the 85 day corn in Darren's example that 85 day corn is going to be ready a lot sooner in the fall it basically takes less heat corn matures based on heat or as some people will call it Growing Degree Days now there's a really good website that you could go to if you want you can access this right off our AG PhD website if you just go to agphd.com under the resources tab you can see Purdue Growing Degree Days and you can literally Zoom down to your farm and it will show you your historic last frost dates in the spring and first Frost dates in the fall and you can plug in hey what's my planting date what's my corn maturity and how does that project over time will I most likely make it in the fall will it mature or will it not because the challenge is if it doesn't make it the frost hits well now you have very light test weight corn you have high moisture corn it's not a good situation you need that crop to finish out to reach black layer to reach physiological maturity prior to the first Frost the big thing is corn is an annual plant so once we get that first killing Frost it's going to kill off the annual plants that just have a one-year growth cycle and as Brian was mentioning as corn is growing it's feeding each Eternal on that ear and until those Kernels have been completely fed and fully developed we're at risk for frost so farmers will adjust the planting date but also the maturity of the hybrids they're planting to try to make sure that happens so this Growing Degree day calculation is based on the high temperature for the day the low temperature for the day you add the two together and you divide that number by two then subtract 50. also the highest high can be 86 the lowest low 50. so those are always the cutoffs the issue that I have with all this Growing Degree day calculation thing is well what if all day it was 52 degrees except for oh all of a sudden the sun came out a heat wave came through for half an hour and it went to 85 Degrees I mean is that really 85 for a high I just I don't think it's super accurate and that's one of the reasons why it does there is some variance there but at least it gets a person fairly close well Farmers have a lot of things to worry about out in fields but getting the great seed with the correct maturity for when it's being planted and where is very important in on corn a good way they can estimate It Is by looking at Growing Degree units and the calendar date so this is just one of the things that farmers have to consider every year on the farm if they want good success but another thing is having great weed

you have to be young to attend anyone can attend it's open to anybody but we are going to focus on a lot of the things the new and exciting things coming out and some of the basics that you need to know as you're getting into Agriculture and with the scholarships portion of it we're going to be giving away over a hundred college scholarships that day super excited about that if you want to learn more about this event just go to agphd.com and if you want to register then you can be eligible for a scholarship if you're going to be attending a post-secondary school beginning this fall so whether

time today we're going to talk about how does a farmer know how much seed to buy for the whole Farm now right away you might say well this sounds super simple you just say oh I got a thousand acres or how many acres you have times I want to plant this number of seeds you multiply it out it's like bam you're done that's not quite that simple so we wanted to explain a little bit more what the farmer has to go through today it's even got a little bit more complicated here just in the last few years with variable rate population right I don't know if we have a single field on our farm I know we don't have a single field where we're planting the exact same population across the whole field we're always looking for a well man here's the good spot and we want more seed in that area and here's a poor spot we want less seed or vice versa depending on what crop we're planting yeah but the good news is we can plan those things out ahead so when we take a look at that on each field we say okay here's all the different rates we want to set up and then the computer program will tell us okay how many total seeds do we need to buy for that whole field the other thing that's changed here in just the last few years has been automatic shutoffs on our Planters so in the past what would happen is we were off all the time and we were trying to buy seed in part because we get to what we call Point rows so not all fields are nice and square some are kind of weird angles and so we'd run across one way and then we'd go across the other way the planter try to shut it off at the right time but you can either shut it off too early or too late and there were always a lot of variables well now we can shut off each individual row as it is about to hit a row that it would cross so it's awesome technology is great it's saving us some seed it's helping us put the seeds in the right places and it's helping us be more accurate when we're going to buy seed in the beginning so if we know how much seed we need and we've got planter control so we can literally plant every square foot just the way we want it not double up or not skip a spot well this is all great but still in the end is it going to work out perfect over all those Acres maybe but maybe not so a lot of farmers will do is look at okay I can return a certain amount of seed at the end of the year so maybe I'm buying big boxes that have 40 or 50 units of seed in them but I'm going to buy a couple of small bags as well so I've got an extra bag just in case I need it and if I don't need it well I can always return that later one other thing I guess I wanted to bring up before we leave this topic is we used to buy soybean seed on our farm by the pound well now we buy buy the actual seed so it's much more accurate than it used to be because before you'd buy 50 pounds well how much does that actually cover nine tenths of an acre a full acre 1.1 Acres we didn't really know the seed count would vary a lot so you were getting random amounts all all the time so this whole process has been much more fine-tuned it's a lot easier and easy makes things a little more fun on the farm it sure does you got to get the right amount

trees down in front of the house used buckets cook the sap down in a pan over a concrete block you know use concrete blocks to hold the pan up we did that for two years and I think the first year we got a quart and a half of Sir maybe and had it in the fridge we loved it and then we built a larger pan and one of my sons built that for me welded stainless steel pan but we also had to cook outdoors with it on on the concrete blocks you know elevated up stick the wood under it and I had a little makeshift chimney on it and we did that for two or three years and I thought I think we can get a

buckets and then we store it in 50 gallon barrels in the cooler and I just drop a five gallon uh chunk of ice in it and it keeps it cool until I'm ready to use it probably about 600 gallons of sap so

three of it's wooded and I've got 350 TAPS in 120 trees most of my trees are 50 years old they're over 20 inch diameter they'll take three Taps and then I have some leases don't exactly keep track of all that because I just tie up every tree I can find but I've got over a mile of tubing I'm too lazy to haul buckets of sap and a pool vacuum and that that pulls gases out of the tree it accelerates

the purpose of partnership better than virtually anyone for years leader Mitch McConnell has recognized the essential role this institution plays in helping grow and build a Kentucky that is healthier wealthier and wiser he has made Kentucky his life's work and he has been our steady and steadfast partner in our mission to transform and Advance this state from Cancer Care to translational science from the scourge of opioid misuse to the agricultural institutions and Innovations we are celebrating today he has pushed he has supported us to do more and be more for the state we all serve the bottom line is simply this the 65.9 million dollars that is making this lab a reality would not have happened without Senator McConnell's strong support and Leadership when this project was first conceived more than a decade ago we turn to Senator McConnell often and unfailingly he is there to answer our story as an institution as many chapters and authors Senator McConnell has been one of

has helped make today possible our next speaker understands our history and the purpose of partnership better than virtually anyone for years leader Mitch McConnell has recognized the essential role this institution plays in helping grow and build a Kentucky that is healthier wealthier and wiser he has made Kentucky his life's work and he has been our steady and steadfast partner in our mission to transform and Advance this state from Cancer Care to translational science from the scourge of opioid misuse to the agricultural institutions and Innovations we are celebrating today he has pushed he has supported us to do more and be more for the state we all serve the bottom line is simply this the 65.9 million dollars that is making this lab a reality would not have happened without Senator McConnell's strong support and Leadership when this project was first conceived more than a decade ago we turn to Senator McConnell often and unfailingly he is there to answer our story as an institution as many chapters and authors Senator McConnell has been one of those authors of our story it's Kentucky's story it is my honor to ask Senator McCollum to come forward to share some remarks on a very special day [Applause] mm-hmm [Applause] well thank you very much Dr capilouto it's no uh secret I didn't grow up on a farm but when I found myself in the United States Senate a number of years ago in looking at Kentucky's strengths to enhance and capitalize on agriculture was right at the top of the list so I joined the agriculture committee and uh subsequently the agriculture subcommittee of Appropriations that's where the money is and decided to focus on the UK College of Agriculture over the over the years and and Dean Cox you all have never disappointed me and has built

Health you're also talking about the survival of the livestock industry because there are folks around the world who are interested in trying to restrict and curtail the livestock industry because of methane emissions so the research that's done here to figure out ways in which that can be reduced really is an opportunity to extend this important industry not just to Kentucky but to uh to the

infiltration but you can see the crop looks really good for the fact it really hasn't had significant rain since planting and we just hope we get some but it's just one of the additional benefits to the cover crop besides the nitrogen yeah similar story at Eastern Iowa at Ryan Gibbs Farm where they've gotten even less rain over the past month he's been no-telling for about five years and tells our Michaela Faulkner that his decision to start using cover crops is really paying off in these dry conditions we've had roughly two tens maybe three tenths of an inch of rain in the last 35 days but the cover crop has just really protected the soil I mean look at that we're not even an inch deep and we're hitting moisture on this and that's underneath of this residue and this is like beach sand

extreme drought the post received over 100 comments from other Growers trying to offer advice on how he could have managed the cover crop differently to avoid significant damage to his corn crop Penn

see that the soybeans are up and have a true Leaf in the in the standard termination treatment but are just really cracking and starting to emerge in the planting green treatments and I attribute this difference in early season growth of soybeans to soil moisture Dynamics so we killed this cover crop at the end of April and that following week we got about three inches of rain and then we have not had really any measurable level of rain for about three to four weeks now so we're really quite dry for May and for planting conditions this season and so because we allowed that cover crop to grow we gained some biomass production but it also probably created a soil moisture deficit as it continued to pull that soil moisture out and we planted in a much drier conditions in the planting green

Benchmark study so I thought it would be fun to share some of the numbers with Purdue University's strip till expert Tony Vin live on Zoom so we can get his instant unscripted reaction here's some highlights from our conversation check it out average strip till yields 207 for corn and 61 for soybeans both the head of U.S averages and also had a no-till counterpart so I bet you're not surprised by that not at all so those are those numbers are right in line with where I think strepto producers are on average um even if you assume there was no advantage in terms of earlier planting my

highest soybean total in the 10-year history of the survey so maybe more people are catching on to the advantages of strip tilling soybeans yes and I think that's a good thing it's also come about

Vin live on Zoom so we can get his instant unscripted reaction here's some highlights from our conversation check it out average strip till yields 207 for corn and 61 for soybeans both the head of U.S averages and also had a no-till counterpart so I bet you're not surprised by that not at all so those are those numbers are right in line with where I think strepto producers are on average um even if

      "page_content=\"goals the ultimate question is do those landowners bear responsibility for the deaths of people that were on that Highway and my answer is yes of course this wasn't the first time that wind erosion had blown across there uh you're being negligent that you don't have the soil armored as we call it in the soil Health movement so you were letting this precious resource get away I'm sure you're dusted blown across that Highway before so you know there were at fault they could have stopped this and people died because of this so I you know I like so many people when we see a lot of erosion now is I mean people that don't even Farm ask me how this can be that we still see blowing soils and we seals still see massive erosion and all this ground being worked and I can't answer that except you know change is difficult but in this case you know it costs people their lives but ultimately losing all this soil is going to cost a lot of people their lives because we won't be able to feed the world at this rate of soil loss so what do you think will happen now that the story is getting attention and seemingly had there been cover crops and no-till these people these six people seven people didn't die in 30 didn't end up in the hospital well what will be the reaction legislatively or lost legal you know litigation what do you think is going to happen you know for decades we've had other environmental disasters and I would assume that just as in others nothing will happen nothing will change it uh change is difficult and farmers are hard to change and you know they're gonna say and I imagine maybe the Farm Bureau will defend them it's not it's not their fault but i as a conservationist and terrified about the loss of soil and the degration of our countries natural resources this is a bad sign and it's not like we all haven't been seeing it for your entire lifetime people like Frank lesseter and no-till magazine have made an impact but it's certainly not fast enough the rate of loss is still far higher than a rate of gain we're making we've got the answer there's no debate in that we've got the answer to Gulf hypoxia and climate change and feeding people and all of nutrient loss we've got the answer now being able to communicate that the way Dave good the way no-till farmer that's one of the keys education and communication that is it happening fast enough it's not so we all like Dave Brandt anytime we get asked to go speak anytime we ask for somebody to come look at your equipment and see how you're seeding copper crops with a

will it wake some people up yeah no I think it will wake some people up legislatively I doubt that there will be any legislation that will do something like a Band-Aid maybe let's put some logs up along the road like they do out west to keep the drifts where I'm going out can you imagine we're going to put up logs to keep the soil from drifting and blowing across the highway but certainly That Others May think about this and say you know we can't let our farm blow away so I'm hoping some good will come out of it but will there be a big change you know it's like so many I doubt it but I hope it does I hope it does I'm doing a hundred percent of everything I can and it's not good enough I'm always searching for a way to do a better job at it you know so you know it's a long learning curve

to make a change but before when I tried to seek appointments in the USDA and so forth I'd been told several times don't do it you're having more of an impact with what you're doing privately what you're doing out here across the country is having\" metadata={'source': 'NlWRH3WTM6s', 'text': \"goals the ultimate question is do those landowners bear responsibility for the deaths of people that were on that Highway and my answer is yes of course this wasn't the first time that wind erosion had blown across there uh you're being negligent that you don't have the soil armored as we call it in the soil Health movement so you were letting this precious resource get away I'm sure you're dusted blown across that Highway before so you know there were at fault they could have stopped this and people died because of this so I you know I like so many people when we see a lot of erosion now is I mean people that don't even Farm ask me how this can be that we still see blowing soils and we seals still see massive erosion and all this ground being worked and I can't answer that except you know change is difficult but in this case you know it costs people their lives but ultimately losing all this soil is going to cost a lot of people their lives because we won't be able to feed the world at this rate of soil loss so what do you think will happen now that the story is getting attention and seemingly had there been cover crops and no-till these people these six people seven people didn't die in 30 didn't end up in the hospital well what will be the reaction legislatively or lost legal you know litigation what do you think is going to happen you know for decades we've had other environmental disasters and I would assume that just as in others nothing will happen nothing will change it uh change is difficult and farmers are hard to change and you know they're gonna say and I imagine maybe the Farm Bureau will defend them it's not it's not their fault but i as a conservationist and terrified about the loss of soil and the degration of our countries natural resources this is a bad sign and it's not like we all haven't been seeing it for your entire lifetime people like Frank lesseter and no-till magazine have made an impact but it's certainly not fast enough the rate of loss is still far higher than a rate of gain we're making we've got the answer there's no debate in that we've got the answer to Gulf hypoxia and climate change and feeding people and all of nutrient loss we've got the answer now being able to communicate that the way Dave good the way no-till farmer that's one of the keys education and communication that is it happening fast enough it's not so we all like Dave Brandt anytime we get asked to go speak anytime we ask for

      "page_content=\"[Music] Hi, I'm Chris Clark with the University of Wisconsin\\xa0\\nExtension. Hi I'm Daniel Smith\\xa0\\xa0 Southwest Regional agronomist for the\\xa0\\nNutrient Pest Management program at the\\xa0\\xa0 University of Wisconsin-Madison. Chris\\xa0\\nwe're out here thinking about pre-sidedress nitrate tests. Which fields are good\\xa0\\ncandidates for this test? Yeah I think I really think this is an underused tool. So I'm\\xa0\\nusing it on on your corn fields, those that have\\xa0\\xa0 a history of manure as well as fields that maybe\\xa0\\nhave a previous legume, and I really think it's\\xa0\\xa0 a great tool for the cover crops to be able to\\xa0\\ndetect if nitrogen is going to be immobilized. When\\xa0\\xa0 should we be taking these samples? So there's\\xa0\\na couple of different options to think about,\\xa0\\xa0 when you could think about four to six weeks after\\xa0\\nplanting, you could think about your vegetative\\xa0\\xa0 stages from V3 to V5, and those would be a good\\xa0\\ntiming for pulling those samples. Great, what are\\xa0\\xa0 the steps to actually collecting the sample out\\xa0\\nin the field? Once you've decided which fields\\xa0\\xa0 are good candidates, is get yourself a bucket, it's\\xa0\\nprobably going to be really helpful to borrow or\\xa0\\xa0 get a soil probe, because this sample you have to\\xa0\\nget a foot deep. It's a deeper soil sample compared\\xa0\\xa0 to your regular fertility samples. Also think\\xa0\\nabout your soil type because this sample\\xa0\\xa0 or the results that we get from the university, is\\xa0\\ntied to its soil yield potential. So if you know\\xa0\\xa0 that the top portion of the field is yielding\\xa0\\nbetter than the lower portion of the field, make\\xa0\\xa0 those two separate samples.

Hi I'm Daniel Smith\\xa0\\xa0 Southwest Regional agronomist for the\\xa0\\nNutrient Pest Management program at the\\xa0\\xa0 University of Wisconsin-Madison. Chris\\xa0\\nwe're out here thinking about pre-sidedress nitrate tests. Which fields are good\\xa0\\ncandidates for this test? Yeah I think I really think this is an underused tool. So I'm\\xa0\\nusing it on on your corn fields, those that have\\xa0\\xa0 a history of manure as well as fields that maybe\\xa0\\nhave a previous legume, and I really think it's\\xa0\\xa0 a great tool for the cover crops to be able to\\xa0\\ndetect if nitrogen is going to be immobilized. When\\xa0\\xa0 should we be taking these samples? So there's\\xa0\\na couple of different options to think about,\\xa0\\xa0 when you could think about four to six weeks after\\xa0\\nplanting, you could think about your vegetative\\xa0\\xa0 stages from V3 to V5, and those would be a good\\xa0\\ntiming for pulling those samples. Great, what are\\xa0\\xa0 the steps to actually collecting the sample out\\xa0\\nin the field? Once you've decided which fields\\xa0\\xa0 are good candidates, is get yourself a bucket, it's\\xa0\\nprobably going to be really helpful to borrow or\\xa0\\xa0 get a soil probe, because this sample you have to\\xa0\\nget a foot deep. It's a deeper soil sample compared\\xa0\\xa0 to your regular fertility samples. Also think\\xa0\\nabout your soil type because this sample\\xa0\\xa0 or the results that we get from the university, is\\xa0\\ntied to its soil yield potential. So if you know\\xa0\\xa0 that the top portion of the field is yielding\\xa0\\nbetter than the lower portion of the field, make\\xa0\\xa0 those two separate samples. The other thing is\\xa0\\none sample should equal about 20 acres and then\\xa0\\xa0 within that 20 acre region you want to take 15\\xa0\\nto 20 cores, put that into the pail, mix it up,\\xa0\\xa0 put it into your soil bag, and then make sure\\xa0\\nthat you are either keeping it cool or you\\xa0\\xa0 can freeze that overnight before you send it\\xa0\\nto the lab.

Today we're out in the field talking\\xa0\\nabout the pre-side dress nitrate test. What are\\xa0\\xa0 some considerations for this test?

It's a test that's going to help\\xa0\\nlook at nitrates coming from organic sources in\\xa0\\xa0 your soil, which we have a lot of. One of them being\\xa0\\nmanure.

We're going\\xa0\\nto assess the organic matter and we're also going\\xa0\\xa0 to look at any residues that are out there. Who\\xa0\\nshould be taking this test? Yeah like I said anyone\\xa0\\xa0 that's a corn grower. I feel like this\\xa0\\nis a really underutilized test, so corn growers\\xa0\\xa0 should pay attention to this and as I mentioned\\xa0\\nearlier, anyone that's manuering their fields,\\xa0\\xa0 so those types of growers.

What are some other\\xa0\\nconsiderations for the test? Yeah the test\\xa0\\xa0 works really really great during ideal growing\\xa0\\nconditions.

With all\\nthose pesticides a lot of times we're up against this decision on whether we should put an\\nadjuvant in with a pesticide or not. Can you just tell us what an adjuvant is?

So how do we make the decision\\non whether we actually need an adjuvant in the tank or not? Sometimes you know we do\\nsometimes we don't, that can be a hard decision. Yeah Damon that's a great questio. You're\\nreally going to want to think about your farm finances first, because if the product is\\nreally expensive and you are not really going to see a return, you might not want to invest\\nin something like that.

I do have a you\\xa0\\nknow a little issue with the term fertility value,\\xa0\\xa0 and we've talked about that.

From an AG water quality\\xa0\\nstandpoint, is there a gold standard cover crop?\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah I think you know rye is a good starter crop,\\xa0\\nbut I also think it's about water quality. It's\\xa0\\xa0 not fun and exciting, but it does the job.\\xa0\\nIt fits well into corn and soybean systems,\\xa0\\xa0 because you can plant it so late and even if\\xa0\\nit doesn't germinate in the fall, we do tend\\xa0\\xa0 to see spring growth in February when we get those\\xa0\\nwarmer days.

So a cover crop can be a great tool to\\xa0\\nhelp reduce soil loss from the landscape,\\xa0\\xa0 the cover crop is going to hold the soil\\xa0\\nin place, we're going to see a much greater\\xa0\\xa0 impact after a small grain than say after\\xa0\\ncorn and soybeans in most of the state of\\xa0\\xa0 Wisconsin and then we can also think about\\xa0\\nthat cover crop is holding the soil in place,\\xa0\\xa0 so it's going to help us manage our phosphorus\\xa0\\nindex issues as well.

It's like not many\\xa0\\npeople can do it but I can do it. I put some solar panel on it on, this is 100 watt,\\xa0\\xa0 I connect it to this wire and bring it inside\\xa0\\nmy mobile house and connect it to the portable\\xa0\\xa0 battery inside. This is the battery, I use it\\xa0\\nfor well everything - refrigerator, laptop.\\xa0\\xa0 This is a table, I use it as a kitchen\\xa0\\nand working table as well.

      "page_content=\"This orchard has around 350 cultivars. Some of them haven't even fruited yet. So sometimes I have no idea which tree is which. At first I collected everything I could get hold of but later I became a bit more selective. Sometimes I came across a variety where I thought, 'let evolution take care of this one'. I was born into a dissident family of sorts. I have always been most interested in what isn't mainstream. Some people are allergic to apples. Among these old cultivars, there are quite a few that people with allergies to modern cultivars can eat without any problem. Many of the old cultivars have a high polyphenol content. Polyphenols block proteins that in modern breeds trigger an allergic reaction. I also collected cultivars that were never intended to be consumed fresh but that only shine after being processed in a certain way. These types of apples were called 'industry apples' in the past. From this region south of Hamburg, for example, the cultivar called 'Horneburger Pancake'. That apple is simply wonderful when baked but not particularly memorable eaten straight off the tree. [At the end of the 1980s], I thought to myself: 'People have been growing fruits for hundreds of years, so for much longer than the chemical industry has been around. There must be varieties that thrive without spraying.' When I started digging around, I found an incredible diversity of old cultivars. Reading about old varieties in historical sources was not the only thing that excited me. What I loved about rediscovering old cultivars was that it involved all my senses. Tasting old cultivars and then suddenly encountering flavors and aromas that were just so incredible. Straight rows of tall-stemmed trees - that's simply not good enough! I always wanted so much more to be going on! I wanted my orchard to have understory growth, bushes, and herbaceous plants. Everything is supposed to partake in the composition of an ecosystem that's as diverse as possible and influencing one another. We're standing here in front of a wild fruit hedge that has 17-18 different types of plants. From the beginning I wanted this hedge to be in service of insects, animals and birds rather than us humans. This tree here is called cornelian cherry [Cornus Mas] and it's amazing for bees because it flowers so early in the year. Insects can't start brooding if they can't find any feed and the pollen is like a protein-rich baby food for the offspring of insects. Cornelian cherries produce masses of pollen. Actually this is a tree that many more people should consider planting in their garden. I got a couple of basket hives here that allow me to practice a more natural way of beekeeping that doesn't just exploit bees but treats them with care that allows them to cope with environmental pollution and parasites and doesn't use any chemicals. While beekeeping is not the main work here on site it's absolutely crucial because because without the bees nothing would work here. These magnificent bushes behind me here are hazelnuts. This spring I saw for the first time how valuable they really are for our insects. During the first warm sunny days in February, sometimes even earlier they start to bloom and there are so many bees sitting on them their foraging pants laden with thick pollen. And of course hazelnuts grow into nice big bushes that provide great nesting opportunities for birds. This is one of nearly 50 bird boxes we have installed here in the last season after a number of years of really bad experiences with animal pests, specifically with winter moth, a little green caterpillar. The blue tits can take care of the problem but of course for that you need to provide them some kind of housing.

Some of them haven't even fruited yet. So sometimes I have no idea which tree is which. At first I collected everything I could get hold of but later I became a bit more selective. Sometimes I came across a variety where I thought, 'let evolution take care of this one'. I was born into a dissident family of sorts. I have always been most interested in what isn't mainstream.

i was hoping for but as you know i've been pretty busy and i think what i want to do in this video is to show you how we're going to do this and so we have this tunnel all cleared out and this is something that you could use if you're putting beds to rest for the winter time as well but of course you probably know that we're taking the summer off here and so we're trying to get the beds nice and comfy and settled in for planting into the fall so i'll show you how we're going to do that i'm over here now in front of tunnel three and you can see we've already got the tarp pulled out on this one we've already gotten this one ready and got the tarp on it and so the main idea here is that we're gonna add a bunch of moisture we're going to layer in some materials and then we're going to pull the tarp over it and let everything break down smother any weeds and just protect the soil while we're not growing in it so let me show you the tunnel 2 which we're going to work on today here i am inside tunnel 2 and you can see that there really isn't much going on here this looks like an empty tunnel and what we've done so far is we just pulled out all the crops so we pulled out what we could and then the crops that we could we terminated them at soil level just by cutting them off and leaving the roots in the ground try to let them break down similar style to what we always do but besides that we haven't done much but the one thing that we have done is that we added a lot of moisture and i want to talk about that for a second now when you're in a tunnel and you're it's not raining in here obviously so you never get a large flush through the soil and over time when you're irrigating with drip or overhead or whatever you're using you're adding moisture but all that moisture is getting absorbed by the plants by the soil and what's left behind are any salts or minerals that are in your water and you can get a buildup of salt over time of course depending on how much you're irrigating what's in your water those kinds of things now i haven't really seen that yet here but i want to be a little proactive about it and sort of be ahead of it now what you can do is kind of what we did here is you need to take a moment some point during the year and just put a lot of water down at once and this creates like a rinsing effect through the soil now when you're outside obviously you get rain events and it'll flush the soil pretty often but inside you don't have that so what we did is we tried to water in here really heavily this week and to try to just push as much through the soil now i remember first hearing about this thinking well you're using the same water that you are using when you're irrigating but the thing is now is that you're it's not just getting absorbed it's like flushing through so put down a good amount of water which we've done it's pretty moist in here and that's going to do that flushing of the the salt but also we're going to be adding some material to the tunnels to the beds and then covering it with the tarp and so we want to get some moisture in there to help break down those materials keep the soil biology active uh because when we pull the tarp over here over it we want to make sure that everything's happy underneath in addition to the water the one other thing we did is we pulled up the wooden stakes that were in the ground

little bit and show you so you know it's not fully broken down but because we chopped up pretty good you can see this is going to be fantastic so we're going to add a couple buckets of this per bed and then we're going to be adding some compost so i still have some commercial compost i need to get out of the driveway anyway so we're going to use that and it's actually okay that it's not fully

obviously collected leaves off the property and just let them sit here and break down so hopefully by doing this when we pull the tarp off in the fall the bed should be pretty happy we won't really

enough making videos but can you tell everyone a little bit about what the channel is going to be and first of all you you help convince myself that i do have enough content you do to film year round because i myself and another guy cook on a chuck wagon around the state of north carolina and a little bit of virginia and we do anywhere from five to seven shows a year that's not enough for year-round content but i have been cooking outdoors since i was 11 years old over 40 years and with that background i also am into some unusual cooking so that's what my channel is going to be about cooking on a chuck wagon outdoor cooking and some unusual cooking if you don't know what a chuck wagon is a lot of people don't watch the channel all right because there's going to be some education about what the chuck wagon the different parts of a chuck wagon and how we use it on the trail all right so if you don't know what a chuck wagon is or you want to see what jean's up to it's going to be really interesting there's not a lot of cool cooking stuff i'll leave a link for that down below gene would you say like a week week and a half from now probably july 26th all right so take a look out for that also go give jean some loves get some subscribers let's kick off this channel so looking forward to it man and i'll be talking about how you can do it inside your house oh awesome so there'll be a lot of content for people doing all sorts of kinds of yeah you don't necessarily have to cook it outside very cool man excited yeah i'm excited too [Music] we got the tarp pulled out and

take this opportunity to try to kill any weeds that are going to be there so you're going to use that occultation method where we're using the tarp to force germinate everything so you need some moisture in there to do that so seeds will germinate they'll grow it's covered with a tarp so they'll die so we'll get some weed prevention for future plantings so that's also a great benefit here so

everything's working of course i have to play with all my audio video stuff all the time so hopefully this is all working let me know if everything's sounding looking okay um welcome everybody so this if you are i'll let everyone give everyone a few minutes to chime in here um this is the last live q a for the course and i want to run this this q a similar to all the other ones like so as usual we'll take questions on module 19 and then i'll open up for general questions but before we start with that i do want to just talk uh for a few minutes generally let's see here okay welcome everybody i know a lot of people watch this after the fact um which is crazy and cool um but i want to talk for just a moment about the course um and and sort of the channel and stuff like that so first of all huge thanks to diego and paper pot co um i just i know i say this all the time and i it's truly um i really do feel that way like i'm very appreciative of their support for making this whole thing happen because it literally wouldn't happen without them um okay cool and so uh yeah i do want to say that please go show them some support um at least go check out what they have for sale over there check out diego's content as well and let them know you enjoy the course um i think they'll be really cool uh also do you wanted me to let you know that the jang cedar is now back in stock so it was like out of stock i think he's told me like everywhere in the country so if you're looking for one i would go grab one now you guys know how things are right now uh some stuff's just hard to grab so definitely go pick that up um all right cool so as i said i want to speak sort of generally about the course and the channel for for a few moments all while i have this opportunity uh this course was something that i had been thinking about for a while but never really could understand how i was going to pull it off because it was way it wasn't way more time than i thought but it was it was a big project and i don't know if any of you have ever done video production or taught a course in general or was a teacher each one was a complicated lesson that i had to pull together and then go i had to organize the whole thing and then go and shoot it and then edit it and find all the b-roll all the footage you know that i had to put in for the course and then um put it all together and you know it's one thing if you make a 40 minute video you wind up watching it a few times so the time adds up uh pretty significantly and so um it's just it's a nice accomplishment i feel i'm really pumped about it and to be able to give away for free and uh that was like something i want to do forever and uh anyways i'm really pumped about it and i was able to do this live every single week to follow it and i think for those of you who were following along and coming to the lives and i really appreciate you guys and i feel like i really have been kind of teaching a course in a weird way and uh a lot of you know that i taught high school math for five years um and so i've missed being in a classroom since then in some ways some ways no uh but i've always been a natural teacher and that's something i really enjoy doing so this was awesome i was hoping to do more in-person stuff like at raleigh city farm in the last few years obviously i'm not there anymore in covid and all that stuff so this is sort of a way for me to do that and then this will live up on youtube for free for everybody i'm not going to like put it behind a paywall in a few months and make me pay for it so it's up

that's almost ready to cover up so then we'll have tunnel three to do and then there's a bunch of other cleanup around the farm i feel like by then we're gonna have to start seeds again so if you

      "page_content=\"about it like on air maybe it was off air but context is so important to remember with all this stuff and depending on the varieties that you're growing but and how much time you want to put into it for me once the lettuce is up to size during half the year it has to get harvested pretty much immediately if i wait a week it's going to bolt like or two weeks it's going to bolt so if i just go through and start picking leaves off it's not even going to matter because like a week later the thing's going to be like up to here the heat here grows so fast so i get plenty of regrowth in the in the winter time harvesting the way i do i save a lot of time harvesting which is important to me um i spend more time harvesting washing and packing than anything else on the farm and so i need to be able to harvest as quickly as possible especially in my situation where i'm part-time and i'm really trying to eke out like you know the maximum efficiency so i think it's something you should experiment with especially if you're on small scale i think it would be cool or maybe have one bed to try it maybe it works better for your context for me though like the way i've been harvesting is working really well for me i'm getting crazy yield so um thanks for bringing that up though that's a great point about uh harvesting lettuce and that there's there's lots of ways to do this and i've been really upfront the last three plus years on my channel is that i just share with you guys what i do it doesn't mean it's the right way to do anything and i think that's always important to remember that whenever you're watching reading listening to another farmer or gardener like they'll tell you how they do it and you need to sort of take all that information and then piece it together and try things and see what works what doesn't work um and sort of make your own systems from all of that information so yeah that's very cool hey joey simeon good to see you in here kyle and coda thank you hey kevin good evening i guess wow that's a lot of cabbage nice dude oh thanks jay i got the videographer approval uh yep 100 all right yeah yeah so i didn't talk anything about micro greens um [Music] i have done videos about micro greens in the past um when i used to grow them i don't know what the video is called it's like harvesting and watching sunflower shoots or something i don't know this is years ago i don't grow them anymore so what was your question here oh field micros i've never grown field micros they were all grown inside um one thing i'd probably do is harvest them as soon as possible in the morning before the heat comes in um and if they're wet then you have to dry them somehow or they're gonna like rot real fast so i would probably like put them on a drying screen on real low speed and just kind of be very delicate with them but get the moisture off or lay them out and pat them down with towels or something like that like get the moisture off um sunflower microgreens damping off i'm not sure what that term means but um sunflower micros i used to wash them with my bubbler salad spinner drying screen because i want to get i use that to get the holes off and then i would dry them fully on the drying screen before i package them so that's what i used to do peas i was growing them inside they would just get harvested go right in the bag they were dry they were clean i was growing them under grow lights in my um in my garage and bottom watering so they were totally clean i'm not really answering your question new year um i haven't grown field micro so but anyway you get the moisture off is important any profitable crops that don't necessarily need to be washed other than kale um any fruiting crop really tomatoes

least i grouped things sort of in the right or like together so it was like you know flipping beds and planting and all that kind of stuff so but yeah there's so much information like i remember watching these videos and i'm like wow there's just it's just packed full of information so i'm just i'm just feel great that i can just put that out there for sure oh thank you so much andrew yeah

crops so um i showed this in the module that we're talking about but i i alright so there's two there's two situations one is um if you have if you leave the greens on or not so that's a different sort of procedure in some ways so if i am topping them taking the greens off the root crops in the field i'll just have two totes i'll harvest it i'll twist off the uh the greens like the tops and then i'll throw that in a bin that goes in the compost and then the root will go in another bin and then once i get my weight using the scale i'll bring it inside and just fill up that container with water and let them soak for a little bit that'll loosen up the soil and so that for me that would be beets and carrots that's how i would do it and then after i i'd probably do those early on and then let them soak unless it's crazy hot outside then i would do the lettuce first get that in the fridge then go do the roots but in terms of the washing i just dump them all in my sink and then i spray them off and put them on the drying screen and then after however much time i have before the lettuce is starting to come through i'll then transfer it over to my like that rolling rack and then everything can dry on there and hang out until done with the lettuce if i'm doing it with the greens on so carrots or beets uh i never leave the the greens on carrots because my chefs don't want the greens uh some of the chefs do want the greens on the beets though because they cook with them they make like a braising greens dish they'll cook it with like kale and chard and spinach and whatever else uh and for those i just um i don't soak them but i just spray them off um because and in the sink and then put on the drying screen and then transfer them over the rack so that's how i do that yeah you want to get all the soil off for sure the problem is once you get wet you have to dry it so you have to have a drying screen with fans or pla enough racks to let things dry out you want to make sure you get them dry so would i use the bubbler for whole lettuce that is a great question i've never sold head lettuce so what you can do though is turn the bubbler and then just stick the head in uh with the with like the the leaves down so like if it's growing this way you turn it upside down and let it bubble in there like bubble up into the leaves and then take it out shake it off and

would do it and then after i i'd probably do those early on and then let them soak unless it's crazy hot outside then i would do the lettuce first get that in the fridge then go do the roots but in terms of the washing i just dump them all in my sink and then i spray them off and put them on the drying screen and then after however much time i have before the lettuce is starting to come through i'll then transfer it over to my like that rolling rack and then everything can dry on there and hang out until done with the lettuce if i'm doing it with the greens on so carrots or beets uh i never leave the the greens on carrots because my chefs don't want the greens uh some of the chefs do want the greens on the beets though because they cook with them they make like a braising greens dish they'll cook it with like kale and chard and spinach and whatever else uh and for those i just um i don't soak them but i just spray them off um because and in the sink and then put on the drying screen and then transfer them over the rack so that's how i do that yeah you want to get all the soil off for sure the problem is once you get wet you have to dry it so you have to have a drying screen with fans or pla enough racks to let things dry out you want to make sure you get them dry so would i use the bubbler for whole lettuce that is a great question i've never sold head lettuce so what you can do though is turn the bubbler and then just stick the head in uh with the with like the the leaves down so like if it's growing this way you turn it upside down and let it bubble in there like bubble up into the leaves and then take it out shake it off and then you have to dry it too so yeah you can\"}\n",

lettuce for me if i cut it or not it's gonna pull no man it's the heat like i i there was there was i planted way too much too quickly this spring and i had all these beds and like i didn't get around

let's see levi jackson are you still growing the cherokee mere magenta mix i was growing up for cutlets but wasn't a pretty ability to grow in the heat okay star struck mix okay i haven't tried that one um so of the i'm not growing that anymore um and the reason for that is that i wanted a more delicate variety to sell to restaurants i didn't think i loved that mix that cherokee mirror magenta mix and it's mostly mirror it's like 70 mirror that i was doing like 15 cherokee 15 um magenta i believe that was the mix it was mostly mirror and i love that mix it was super hearty it was great in the summer and the winter for me meer did the best of all those varieties for sure um i don't remember which one was better cherokee or magenta in the heat uh but i stopped growing it because as i said i wanted the salanova it the restaurant it's like perfect for my restaurant accounts so that's what i've been i switched to um but it's not as i wasn't as impressed with its heartiness compared to those other varieties those are just like the leaves are thicker and bigger and tougher so i had a lot of good really luck with that but that was just my context right so like it could be different from where you are hey blake uh with your packing do you ever leave the bag open depending on the crop you draw oh yes okay so uh the the bags that i leave open would be for the beets mainly because they don't fit in there and i can't close them if they have the like the greens on them so for those i would leave them open uh just because the bags aren't big enough to seal them but in terms of lettuce yes they always get sealed um also for carrots because i'm taking the tops off those get sealed so yeah they always get sealed it's also like um i just feel like it's like cleaner when i'm transporting and delivering them too it's like i washed it i dried it i put in a bag closed it off um it keeps it really clean and stuff so yeah i guess the beats with the greens on i would not close them because i can't the bags they're not uh they're not long enough um all right so very welcome uh although i'll say we'll say also back to the other question as i'm continuing to think about this

that let's talk about water for a second so the city water that you if you're on city water and there's lots of chlorine um hopefully it's at a level that you can drink it right because you know it's your city water so i would just use that uh the one thing i would do is filter the chlorine out for my irrigation water i don't want that in the irrigation water but as long as your water's safe to

might be able to get away with not washing it so if you can get away with not washing it and you just let your customers know that it's not washed that would save you so much time in post-processing for sure i know though for me personally um and people are asking me about uh you know should i do head ladder should i do cut lettuce should i do this right you should do that variety it really always depends on your sales outlets so if your restaurants want head lettuce then grow them head lettuce if they want to cut wash lettuce then do that i know for me once i connected with the chefs that i'm working with and i started selling them cut washed bagged lettuce they were so happy because it lasted over a week which doesn't last none of the stuff they buy off a truck lasts that long and it had a lot of because i'm growing soil grown lettuce and not hydroponic lettuce they they were like yeah it has a lot more structure to it uh it has like it holds up on the plate better when we put stuff on it we put heavy dressings on it but to them one of the biggest selling points was like they can literally open the bag and plate the lettuce and that is a huge advantage to restaurants because if you've ever worked in a restaurant or you sell to a restaurant you know they're always prepping like constantly when you're in there they're always prepping everything so if they can save

      "page_content=\"the main main sales outlet so i talked about this earlier in the course i can't remember which module um yeah farmers markets are if you talk about farmers markets or like supermarkets i'm guessing farmers markets they're awesome um that you can just show whatever you have and you can sell it really depends on your market some markets are crazy cool and there's like tons of customers and you can make a ton of money some of them are um very competitive some of them are not really established enough yet or they're just there are enough customers coming every week or you might go to a market where there's a lot of people there but no one's selling actual produce there's a lot of markets where you go and people are selling crafts and you know prepared foods and stuff like that but no one's selling veggies so you know it really depends but generally speaking if you get yourself in a good situation you can make a lot of money at farmer's markets for sure the other benefit about farmers markets versus let's say restaurants is that you get a lot more money per pound because you're selling in smaller quantities so you have to put in more energy and time packaging into smaller quantities being at the market making all those transactions so for me if i have four to six sales that's all i have in terms of restaurants when i go to a farmer's market you know there's hundreds of sales in a week so or more so it's it's a matter of like how much energy and time you put in but you can definitely clear a lot more money per pound when you sell to farmers markets so that's a huge benefit but again you're trading time like i don't have to spend a full day prepping going to the market doing the market uh packing it up coming home cleaning like i go do my deliveries on back home in two hours um and that's that's the amount of time i have to spend delivering so yeah if you can make a lot of money with it for sure uh just keep in mind that you got to be there's a whole other element to it right it's not just like you show up like you have to have a good setup you have to be able to be engaging with your customers you need to start getting to know

it make sure it's clean it's uh presented well it's not wilting like all the things you need to do so there's more to it but there's you can definitely make more money there than selling restaurants hey kevin asking about carrots so i've never stored carrots long term um i don't have any experience with that generally that's only a week maybe two weeks at most before they either get eaten or or sold in the winter time the best thing i would do is keep them in the ground and only harvest them when you need them of course if you have an area that's like you know snow packed in the winter that's not going to work but carrots get better over the winter time they get sweeter there's some process where they're in the wintertime when they're looking for energy they start converting some of the starches into more simple sugars like winter carrots taste better so i probably leave in the ground as long as you can they don't grow very much in the middle of the winter so that's i probably do that's what i do i just go and harvest what i need every week and then next week come out there's more carrots to grab but if you are gonna store carrots i know the one thing is to make sure you cut the greens off completely because those will rot and then the whole carrot will start to rot again i don't know about size of carrots but one thing for me the size of care is always dictated by the

i i harvest on tuesdays generally let's say i see a crazy cold night on monday night i might harvest on sunday uh or sorry i might harvest on monday because i know that the veggies are gonna look like crap tuesday morning so um that's one thing you want to keep in mind is just make sure you're harvesting it at peak quality i don't think you'd want to harvest it like a week ahead of time you have to

those those crops is that there's bugs that eat them in the summer so a lot of them you can get them to grow but you gotta harvest them right away and you have to have them under netting right from the start but you can grow a lot of those quick growing um nebraska greens in the uh in the summertime um other heat tolerant greens yeah what were we growing we grew a lot of stuff in this last spring a lot of greens we were trialing like tokyo bakana tatsoi um some of those asian greens do really well too but again they grow really fast you just got to get them when they're when they're

options for me they'll have they'll have things they recommend so they know what grows better in different regions because they have customers all over the place and they have seeds that are sort of cultivated and grown to be grown in different areas another thing is if you can find a local seed company that can be helpful too because a lot of the a lot of the stuff that they'll be growing is

money for your products at this point just because things cost more you go to the store and they cost more we should be selling them for more so i think you just need to be very upfront with your customers um if you're selling a chef say hey there'll be a price increase in september there'll be a price there'll be a price increase coming up in a few in a few weeks i don't i think that's

of customers it's not an issue like they're at least getting a hundred hundred fifty dollars you know per delivery not a big deal some weeks or less than others because you didn't have enough so i'm not going to like penalize them for like hey they ordered 200 but i only had 75 dollars worth of stuff for them so like i don't want to put a minimum on there but you know there are there might be some customers that only want to order this does happen including to me where someone want to order less so they'll say oh i want 20 worth of stuff that's where i think it's really tricky because it's

the advantage that i that i tend to focus on is for you know for sustainability and for the environment way less food miles way less gas and fossil fuels at the moment like with most of our culture

but i haven't done any research in the last year or two yep so thanks for coming today yeah there's 19 modules it's pretty much everything i've learned in the last four or five years of farming and

on we sort of hit on this a little bit earlier um the early morning is not really why you wash them you wash them because there's bugs or soil those sorts of things and also your sales like if your customers are expecting washed products then it's a good idea to do that because um you can as we were talking before like a value add early in the morning is what's going to give you the highest quality products so i don't think that's really related to me is that the washing in the early morning you're a great question okay um we talked about this at some point i don't know i've definitely talked about this in several videos i've been open about this so farming is very tough mentally and physically and i think we all need to be conscious of that both of those parts because as you get older as you're working in the summer vegetable farming is or any any farming really but especially vegetable farming where you're working on the ground all the time it's very hard on your body but with mental stuff in that you have crop loss or uh crop loss is usually the big one right when you when you go through and you prep beds you plant stuff and you lose crops for whatever reason that's usually the part that gets me the most i think one thing is to realize that you're not alone that we all have crop flow even the best farmers have crop failure like it happens like don't don't forget that try to figure out what went wrong and try not to repeat it in the future and just take it as a learning experience for sure that's that's something that's hard for sure i think most times that i am upset about something that happened on the farm i have to real i have to like turn that problem into a solution if you guys have heard that expression before so like what happened learn from it try

you're not seeing the ugly stuff most of the time some people show that stuff a little bit mostly not so just remember that you know instagram farm has some uh ugly parts too so keep your head up just remember that it's tough because i know that when you fail on the farm let me back up when you have failures on the farm you take them very personally and you think that you are a failure and you're not but that's definitely that definitely goes through your head so definitely talk it out try to learn from your experiences um and try to be optimistic but realistic at the same time oh yeah you got a bunch of questions here for the first season uh i'd probably say under 10 you want to keep it you keep the number of crops down a lot so you can learn each one take your best guess on i did modules on selecting crops too um but mainly it's based on what you think you can sell so there's two elements of what you're growing it's can you grow it can you get it to harvest there's actually more elements that can you get to harvest can you sell it do people actually want what you're growing and then how much money can you make from it so i'd say definitely limit yourself to just a few crops at first but those are mainly based on what you can sell uh yeah i haven't really done something like that so um if you're looking at meat farmers farmers markets are the best place to do that just chat some people up i tried growing this like my first season but i was a crappy farmer so um i didn't have a lot of luck with it but yeah it can be really cool i've heard good stuff about it yeah so i talked about row cover in the winter growing module uh i buy mine from my local farm store country farm and home they're local so i buy it from them generally it's called agribon or bremay some people call it but agribond is what you'll see it comes in different strengths so i might get this wrong 15 1930 and 50 are the numbers i think 15 is like crazy lightweight it like you could even use it as insect netting supposedly although i've tried it and it was too heavy here in the south i i don't recommend the the extra light 19 is the light it's good for some applications but to me i rip it all the time my favorite is the middle one the 30 i think it would is what it is it is what it is i think the middle i think the middle one is 30 that's the one i like the best and then 50 is like heavy duty if you know you're going to be it's going to be cold maybe using that in the field you can also double it up so you can put two layers on if you want the other option is i actually bought some from farmer's friend too they have very large pieces i bought one that'll cover a whole tunnel so i bought some real cover from them too so yeah that's that's what i use for row cover chop and drop so this comes from a lot of the permaculture stuff a lot of the gardening stuff so i'm not opposed to this at all i think chop and drop if you don't know if you're watching is sort of like you just when you're done or whatever you just chop it and just drop it where it is and so to me that method is more natural that's kind of like more about what happens in nature like things break and fall and they go to the forest floor and they decompose and everything kind of layers up right that's kind of the idea uh we're just doing it and we're assisting in that process so i'm not opposed to it all in certain contexts now in the market gardening world that does not fly for me because we're trying to grow in such intensity in these beds that i want to have beds that i can plant into easily so what we will do or what i will do i should say is remove i leave the roots in the ground because that feeds the soil but when we chop the plant off at at soil level i'll take that material and i'll compost it separately and then they'll get\" metadata={'source': 'pClsEk46CvI', 'text': \"too when you look at instagram or youtube or whatever you generally are only seeing everybody's wins you're seeing everyone's polished products um you're you're they're not you're not seeing the ugly stuff most of the time some people show that stuff a little bit mostly not so just remember that you know instagram farm has some uh ugly parts too so keep your head up just remember that it's tough because i know that when you fail on the farm let me back up when you have failures on the farm you take them very personally and you think that you are a failure and you're not but that's definitely that definitely goes through your head so definitely talk it out try to learn from your experiences um and try to be optimistic but realistic at the same time oh yeah you got a bunch of questions here for the first season uh i'd probably say under 10 you want to keep it you keep the number of crops down a lot so you can learn each one take your best guess on i did modules on selecting crops too um but mainly it's based on what you think you can sell so there's two elements of what you're growing it's can you grow it can you get it to harvest there's actually more elements that can you get to harvest can you sell it do people actually want what you're growing and then how much money can you make from it so i'd say definitely limit yourself to just a few crops at first but those are mainly based on what you can sell uh yeah i haven't really done something like that so um if you're looking at meat farmers farmers markets are the best place to do that just chat some people up i tried growing this like my first season but i was a crappy farmer so um i didn't have a lot of luck with it but

gonna start harvesting we had to like scramble and we put in like long days and long weeks just because we had to get that done he's pretty tough man it's a tough situation to be in um i would probably spend the time working on a wash station that you'll continue to use especially if you have either a year-round farm or somewhere year-round farm because what i've realized is that once this once the the season roll starts rolling that's when you don't have time to be screwing out your watch station so i probably have to get some help for a little while to just get it done work weekends

      "page_content=\"mean so it really depends on that kind of thing like where your strengths and weaknesses your personality your life situation your financial situation you know if you're going in with another partner your farm is going to have to be bigger right because you have to cover both of your salaries a lot of things to consider i don't think there's an easy this is better than that kind of thing i have not tried those um i don't even thought about those i know the elastics are so cheap um also the bags i'm using are pretty big and so the like sometimes the bunch on the top of the bag is pretty big so elastic works well plus um i find that my some of my chefs will actually keep the stuff in the bag and use that as storage so to me it's really easy to take the elastics off and then reuse the bags and then one of my customers i know like they use the bags for some other prep in their kitchen so the elastics are not expensive i bought a few bags in a year like i don't really use that many bags but maybe it works for you if you're looking for smaller bags that bag taper that i talked about in that in the module works great super cheap like you buy one roll of tape it lasts forever would i try tomatoes if you had a salad tunnel a sealed salad tunnel uh it's a caliber so most of you if you've been following along know that i don't grow tomatoes because of the squirrels here because they eat they eat all my tomatoes tomatoes are awesome they're very profitable they take a lot of work but they're very profitable if i had a way of keeping out squirrels probably but again now that i'm not farming in the summer i don't think so so that's again another contextual thing for me because i'm taking the summers off so tomatoes are off the list but you make a lot of money with tomatoes carrots being rubbery after harvest have they already like started rotting is that why i'm not really sure nice okay sarah welcome uh let's see here there was a lot of banter in there i was skipping over some of that stuff um south carolina get four inches in hour rain events oh yeah i know i know those goes my future tunnel site is mostly flat and i'm nervous about standing water since we're on clay so i talked about this in depth in early modules um also in the build-out of this farm if you look back to videos winter 2020 2021 you can watch all that um but as i don't remember the module number but it was early on in like designing your farm all my tunnels are built with drainage ditches between the tunnels off contour so when the water hits the tunnels they go into the ditches they go downhill and away from the farm drainage is something that gets seriously seriously overlooked on farms um that people they'd see oh it's flat let's go it's like when it rains hard especially you said you're in south carolina you know i'm in north carolina we probably get similar weather um when it rains hard that's when you have problems and so even if you're in tunnels if it's flat the water's gonna come back into the tunnel if you don't tell the water where to go it will go probably where you don't want it to go so when we laid out the tunnels again we really thought about this we put three and a half foot wide ditches in between the tunnels and again they're off contour so they're not like parallel with the slope right there they're downhill a little bit in both directions and it just pitches away so when it rains hard and you go out there and you watch it it's just like water running it's running off the tunnels down and away i think a lot of people forget that how much water comes off of a tunnel it's like water coming off a house thanks blake thanks for coming and checking it out hopefully got some stuff out of it you're very welcome kyle and that's why that's that's like the main reason that i wanted to do this for free i i really held back um it was funny not funny it was interesting a lot of people were kind of what's the word um kind of not criticizing but questioning why i\" metadata={'source': 'pClsEk46CvI', 'text': \"mean so it really depends on that kind of thing like where your strengths and weaknesses your personality your life situation your financial situation you know if you're going in with another partner your farm is going to have to be bigger right because you have to cover both of your salaries a lot of things to consider i don't think there's an easy this is better than that kind of thing i have not tried those um i don't even thought about those i know the elastics are so cheap um also the bags i'm using are pretty big and so the like sometimes the bunch on the top of the bag is pretty big so elastic works well plus um i find that my some of my chefs will actually keep the stuff in the bag and use that as storage so to me it's really easy to take the elastics off and then reuse the bags and then one of my customers i know like they use the bags for some other prep in their kitchen so the elastics are not expensive i bought a few bags in a year like i don't really use that many bags but maybe it works for you if you're looking for smaller bags that bag taper that i talked about in that in the module works great super cheap like you buy one roll of tape it lasts forever would i try tomatoes if you had a salad tunnel a sealed salad tunnel uh it's a caliber so most of you if you've been following along know that i don't grow tomatoes because of the squirrels here because they eat they eat all my tomatoes tomatoes are awesome they're very profitable they take a lot of work but they're very profitable if i had a way of keeping out squirrels probably but again now that i'm not farming in the summer i don't think so so that's again another contextual thing for me because i'm taking the summers off so tomatoes are off the list but you make a lot of money with tomatoes carrots being rubbery after harvest have they already like started rotting is that why i'm not really sure nice okay sarah welcome uh let's see here there was a lot of banter in there i was skipping over some of that stuff um south carolina get four inches in hour rain events oh yeah i know i know those goes my future tunnel site is mostly flat and i'm nervous about standing water since we're on clay so i talked about this in depth in early modules um also in the build-out of this farm if you look back to videos winter 2020 2021 you can watch all that um but as i don't remember the module number but it was early on in like designing your farm all my tunnels are built with drainage ditches between the tunnels off contour so when the water hits the tunnels they go into the ditches they go downhill and away from the farm drainage is something that gets seriously seriously overlooked on farms um that people they'd see oh it's flat let's go it's like when it rains hard especially you said you're in south carolina you know i'm in north carolina we probably get similar weather um when it rains hard that's when you have problems and so even if you're in tunnels if it's flat the water's gonna come back into the tunnel if you don't tell the water where to go it will go probably where you don't want it to go so when we laid out the tunnels again we really thought about this we put three and a half foot wide ditches in between the tunnels and again they're off contour so they're not like parallel with the slope right there they're downhill a little bit in both directions and it just pitches away so when it rains hard and you go out there and you watch it it's just like water running it's running off the tunnels down and away i think a lot of people forget that how much water comes off of a tunnel it's like water coming off a house thanks blake thanks for coming and

throats all the time on social media on every youtube video i'd be mentioning the course and talking about it and then it doesn't get to all the people it needs to get to i'd rather just be out there because i think if there's going to be a difference in the world with our food system the more people that either know how to grow it and sell it make money off of it or at least know how it works and why they should support other local farms that's i think that's been a big part of what i've been doing on youtube for the last three years and i showcase other farmers other people in the industry

before too is that i didn't want to do this because i don't think i am expert enough in giving people advice on this sort of stuff like i don't want to give legal advice accounting advice like i that's not i don't feel um i don't feel quality qualified enough to do that necessarily but in the module in the module that i just posted i talked a little bit about how i do invoicing and sales i've talked in on other videos on my channel about how i sell to chefs and how i invoice and do all of that stuff so i have talked about it before sprinkled in but there's not one specifically about it okay cool um yeah you might want to before you before you build tunnels you might want to grade the land a little bit you know that's when you want to do that kind of work um the other thing you can do is you can put in french drains so that's another option too if you want to uh just dig deeper trenches and then put in french drains you can do that that's an option [Laughter] just keep asking me

undergraduate degree in engineering i don't know if anyone really knows that um and what i realized at the end of my school senior year i had a lot of friends that were coming by my place asking for help with their classes classes i never took and i would just be like oh let me see your textbook it was like finance classes and not really marketing it was a lot of like business stuff that i i wasn't i didn't take any of those classes but i just started like helping people with their studies and i realized like oh i really like teaching and then i never got a job as an engineer i went into education i went and got my master's degree in mathematics and then i taught high school math for five years so for me this teaching has always been part of why i love doing youtube and and and being able to share information i just love it it's just fun i don't know it's just something i enjoy doing so a little bit of a backstory why uh i started the youtube channel in the first place and if most of you don't know that um when i started the channel i was really marketing the farm on instagram and people asked me a lot of farming questions and i wanted to be able to spend more than 59 seconds on a video explaining something that i was doing that's how the youtube channel really started oh man oh man i i don't want to get that deep in education today but i appreciate the comment oh man you guys are killing me today um all right so yeah we can talk about that for a second so my other channel which was called content on content when i started but i just changed it to my name because i i don't know i kind of got sick of that to that name but um it's hard too like over there the more i teach about video or like content creation strategy and youtube stuff those videos get like so few views and i know they're helpful for people and i would do i'm going to sprinkle those more in but if i make a video about some technical spec on a camera it just gets a ton of views so uh there will be more of that stuff there's a there's a bunch if you go to the other channel there's a playlist about content creation there that has all my like thoughts on content creation that i've made videos about so you should definitely check that out oh thanks guys the comments they're just awesome uh yeah thanks jimmy and i would love in the future to teach actual in-person market gardening classes um i would love a way to do that i've really been struggling um with how to do this the last few years and the biggest reason is that i can't have people to my farm because it's my house and i live in the suburbs and i just protect my family's privacy you've probably seen that you've never seen my wife or kids in any of my videos like i that's that's my private life and i want to keep it private so i don't have people come to the farm people ask me all the time for visiting i just don't do it um and so that was one of the reasons i wanted to be at raleigh city farmers to have that opportunity so

      "page_content=\"[Music] hey there welcome to module 19 of the satin hill farm course this module is all about harvesting washing packing and selling your products and before we get into it i just had to have a huge thanks to our sponsor paper potco without the help of diego and paper pot go this entire course wouldn't be possible and more on them later in this module i will cover the gear that you'll need some general tips when to harvest harvesting specific things like lettuce baby greens root crops and kale and also go over packaging selling and delivering hope you got a chance to check out the last module which was all about the wash pack station where i go through all the gear that i need to wash and pack all the stuff in my on my farm here and so let's talk about some of the gear you'll need for harvesting first of all you need a bunch of totes uh you don't need anything specific i bought these at lowe's these are like the 18 gallon totes but one thing i want to point out is that you label them as like harvest or field or dirty because what happens over time is they get they get a lot of dirt in them obviously because you're harvesting right out of the ground especially with root crops they can get pretty dirty and so what you want to make sure is that you're not contaminating your clean product so if you are washing products and then storing them in totes label those clean or finished or something like something completely separate you don't want that cross-contamination so when we're done harvesting we rinse these out and then we put them upside down on the drying screen here to let everything dry out so a bunch of these totes are great make sure they fit in your walkways or at least close but yeah you need a bunch of these the next thing is going to be a scale i like analog scales for this to bring onto the field no batteries to replace also it's very easy to tear them and then you don't have to worry about it turning on and off so what i'll do is i'll bring this out to the field i'll put the bin on it and then i'll tear the scale and then i can take this off go do my harvesting bring the toe back and just check the weight now it's really important for me to check the weight out in the field because i want to make sure i harvest enough and i also want to make sure i don't harvest too much so that things don't go to waste once i get into the wash process i want to just be washing i don't have to be going back out and grabbing a few more pounds or whatever especially if you have a crew you can tell them exactly how much to to get and they'll be accurate with it and it gives you a good judge while you're out there another thing is a harvest knife i use these little red serrated knives they're inexpensive i just really like them they work really well rubber bands which we'll use for packaging as well but these are great for bunching crops like kale or chard or green onions things like that i use the same rubber bands and lastly probably the coolest tool is the greens harvester from farmer's friend and this is an awesome tool i highly recommend this you need a cordless drill for this as well if you're doing any sort of baby greens this is an indispensable tool you absolutely need this but it is a little bit pricey i'm doing a lot of baby greens lately so this guy's just been hanging out but this is something you will need if you're doing baby greens before we go over a lot of the specific details in this module i want to give you some general tips just to kick it off so as i was talking about before with the scale and the harvest totes make sure you bring that scale out to the field and tear it and do your weighing out in the field and you always want to harvest a little bit more so for example if you need 10 pounds of lettuce i usually personally tack on like 15 to 20 percent so i would harvest like 11 and a half or 12 pounds when i was at raleigh city farm we had a lot of interns and a lot of

      "page_content=\"tack on like 15 to 20 percent so i would harvest like 11 and a half or 12 pounds when i was at raleigh city farm we had a lot of interns and a lot of variability i used to give them a little bit higher of a number like 30 to 40 percent so if i needed 10 pounds i tell them i'll go get 14 because there's a little bit of quality control you have to do once you get back in the wash pack station maybe you lose a little bit water weight if things are wet all those variables so make sure you have enough because you really don't want to have to go back out in the field if when you're done you have extra product you can either sell it if you have a sales outlet for that like a farm stand or you're going to a farmer's market or you can take some home give it to your friends donate it all that kind of stuff but make sure you have at least a little bit extra you don't want to be short have to go back to the field when you're weighing out the packages make sure that you don't spend a ton of time just trying to get it exactly right so if you're trying to do five ounce bags for example if you're a little bit over that's fine and you definitely want to make sure you're not shorting your customers whatsoever so if you promise five ounces you definitely don't want to be under that if you're giving them two pounds in a bag to a restaurant you don't want to be under that but if when you go over if you're over within point two point three point four ounces that's fine i know a lot of people will really try to be careful about that so you're not wasting too much per bag that's understandable but you can waste a lot of time every single bag if you have to weigh out 50 bags and you're sitting there with each bag for a minute you can see how much time that adds up so that's a thing that you really want to keep in mind shelf life and stability is a big part of how we're going to be harvesting washing packing and storing our crops that's a huge advantage that you have as a farmer that's local is that you can harvest it the day before or the day of and get it to the customers and it's super fresh but you want to make sure that in that process you're not losing quality and one of the biggest things you can do is as soon as you harvest off the field you get it into the cooler so let's get on talking about when you want to be harvesting [Music] a lot of this will depend on what time of year that it is for you but generally speaking in the warmer months you definitely want to harvest as early in the day as possible and sometimes you want to might want to wake up and get out even earlier than usual when it's really hot outside the reason for this is you've probably seen this in the afternoon where the crops don't look so great in the in the full heat they're they kind of limp they're not really happy you can water them a little bit they might perk up but the best they're going to look is first thing in the morning and they're the least amount of stress sometimes if you harvest it later the crops can rebound but generally not you always want to harvest them in the best possible situation especially with lettuce if you harvest it later in the day it will taste more bitter sometimes you'll even cut it and you'll get like a white milky substance that comes out of it you definitely want to try to avoid that harvest it first thing in the morning for sure also keep in mind the time of year because in the warmer months things bolt very quickly especially greens which is one of the my main crops bolting is when the crops grow up and they stretch out tall and they're turn they eventually will put out flowers and then seeds of course you want to harvest it way before that but you want to be careful about each succession and that you're harvesting it early enough if you don't get out there early enough then it might bolt and especially in the warmer months you might have to harvest more than once a week even if you're harvesting only once a week because you could think\" metadata={'source': 'T1PqQpWS238', 'text': \"tack on like 15 to 20 percent so i would harvest like 11 and a half or 12 pounds when i was at raleigh city farm we had a lot of interns and a lot of variability i used to give them a little bit higher of a number like 30 to 40 percent so if i needed 10 pounds i tell them i'll go get 14 because there's a little bit of quality control you have to do once you get back in the wash pack station maybe you lose a little bit water weight if things are wet all those variables so make sure you have enough because you really don't want to have to go back out in the field if when you're done you have extra product you can either sell it if you have a sales outlet for that like a farm stand or you're going to a farmer's market or you can take some home give it to your friends donate it all that kind of stuff but make sure you have at least a little bit extra you don't want to be short have to go back to the field when you're weighing out the packages make sure that you don't spend a ton of time just trying to get it exactly right so if you're trying to do five ounce bags for example if you're a little bit over that's fine and you definitely want to make sure you're not shorting your customers whatsoever so if you promise five ounces you definitely don't want to be under that if you're giving them two pounds in a bag to a restaurant you don't want to be under that but if when you go over if you're over within point two point three point four ounces that's fine i know a lot of people will really try to be careful about that so you're not wasting too much per bag that's understandable but you can waste a lot of time every single bag if you have to weigh out 50 bags and you're sitting there with each bag for a minute you can see how much time that adds up so that's a thing that you really want to keep in mind shelf life and stability is a big part of how we're going to be harvesting washing packing and storing our crops that's a huge advantage that you have as a farmer that's local is that you can harvest it the day before or the day of and get it to the customers and it's super fresh but you want to make sure that in that process you're not losing quality and one of the biggest things you can do is as soon as you harvest off the field you get it into the cooler so let's get on talking about when you want to be harvesting [Music] a lot of this will depend on what time of year that it is for you but generally speaking in the warmer months you definitely want to harvest as

me personally i'm working by myself so i'll go on the field in the morning harvest everything i need to harvest and then put everything in the cooler and then come in and wash now if you have a larger crew or more than one person you might start harvesting together and then one person transition or multiple people transition into the wash pack station and start washing while more stuff is coming off the field you'll have to figure that out for yourself but again the key is start as early as possible in the day [Music] now we'll get on to talking about specific crops and we'll kick it off with lettuce because lettuce is my most important crop there are lots of ways to grow harvest store and sell lettuce you can sell head lettuce and this might do really well at your farmers market you might have chefs that prefer larger leaf lettuce if they're doing like burgers and sandwiches and stuff like that what i found is that i'd like to do a washed cut leaf lettuce and i've been doing the salanova foundation mix it looks really pretty it's very flexible and when i do this when i start my seeds i mix all the seeds together so it's randomized when i transplant on the field it's randomized so when i go through and harvest it then i get a randomized mix of lettuce and i don't have to mix it later so that works really well for me now this my season is now over at ten health arm so i don't have that to show you but i have some older footage here so bear with me and check this out explaining how you should harvest lettuce and also clean up afterwards so we're going to use a simple harvest knife this is a small serrated knife i'll leave a link down below for this it's super cheap this is kind of what i like to use what you want to do is you want to grab the lettuce head with i'm a righty so i grabbed the last time with my left hand and i'm going to make a cut across and pull that off in one bunch so let me do one here and you want to make sure that you don't cut it too low because we want to make sure we try to get a regrowth so there's my cut and i'll often look around the outside look for damage if i have a damaged leaf or two i'll just drop it for now and then in the bin and so as i go through this you can see it's pretty quick and i'm already creating that mix in my tote i'm just going to go through here and get a bunch of harvesting done this lettuce is looking amazing you can see that you can't use the greens harvester for this but it's pretty quick and i usually what i do is i straddle the bed and i just work my way down like this now that it's all harvested and tucked away um i'm going to go through and clean up the bed this only takes a few minutes and it's really important let me show you what i'm talking about all right so i'm going to come through here and just clean this up all these leaves that are touching the ground are not good enough quality to sell some of them are actually kind of dried up and rotten or whatever but i want to make sure that i come through and i just take all the leaves around the base of the plant off what this does is a couple things it keeps those from rotting and it also makes sure you have more air

from growing again so you really want to try to get another cut and so you want to try to get it basically pretty uniform um if you cut it too low you'll see it just won't regrow or grow back really really weak and so i'm going to take over the bed we harvested from last week and i'll show you what that looks like all right so here's some lettuces that we harvested from last week you see some of these you can see where it was cut and where it's regrowing so this is about a week's worth of growth i bet you might get a harvest out of this next week we'll see so these are all hope you guys can

one's dying but you can see if you cut them well they will regrow every success success of cut or harvest the quality goes down a little bit usually especially in the summer as i said you may not get more than one harvest in the summer but you always try um and then you get to a point in the year where you know that's just gonna be one harvest but if you make a nice cut that's not too low you get a nice regrowth so i just wanna show you what that looks like i'm filling up the greens bubble over here so i can show you how i wash and pack lettuce here at the farm it's basically the same way that

know as i'm working through here and one point i want to make about getting a second cut is that most of the year i don't really consider the second cut especially in the warmer months i make one cut of lettuce and that's out because the stuff's growing so quickly the second cut if i get one is usually of lower quality and definitely a lower yield in the cooler months i definitely want to try to get more than one cut because things grow so slowly that if i did transplant new lettuce out it would take way longer and the yields per bed would be less than if i just let it go and then harvested it a couple weeks later i generally do get second cuts in the cooler months but in the warmer ones i definitely don't do that all right so once this is finished i'll show you how to wash some lettuce the greens bubbler is all full of water and the hudson float valve over here shuts it off automatically one thing i do is i just turn the valve off after it's full because i noticed as it's bubbling and you're pulling things out this might kick on and off a little bit as the water level is bouncing around so this is all full ready to go i got some lettuce here as i said it's not very much but i'm gonna dump it in here to show you how this works and this is definitely less i could probably get i usually put about um you know half a toad in there at a time probably six ish pounds maybe more but

false at the bottom so i didn't let that run very long but also because i know it's pretty clean i've already looked at this lettuce and what we're gonna do is we're just gonna scoop it out i use this little fry basket which i talked about before and this goes in the spinner and as i'm doing this as i said in the last module it's really helpful if you have cold water it really does help the keeping the greens as fresh as possible and you can even add ice to your water if uh you know it's not cold enough all right so once we get as i said this was a very very small load this is definitely not the normal level i'd be using but we throw in the salad spinner over here and we kicked that on i usually let it run for about six minutes or so so we just turn that on and we'll come back in a few minutes the spinner's all done spinning and i'm gonna take this and dump it on the drying screen here and as i said before i'm just doing this for demonstration purposes if i was doing this in full

then turn on the fans and make sure that you spread it out otherwise it won't dry i would say generally speaking i can get about five pounds on here comfortably to have it dry um and one thing you want to also keep in mind is the humidity so if it's really humid outside or if you're not in air conditioning that sort of thing then it will take a lot longer to dry so as this is here you want to be fluffing it and moving it around because what will happen is the top layer will dry you also want to keep in mind that you don't want to get it to be too wilted because that'll obviously cause damage to it so you got to keep an eye on you got to feel it every couple minutes you flip it around and you can feel it with your hands to see how wet it is and this sort of works out in the process where all the timing kind of works because while the next round is spinning this is drying and you can just work it around in a cycle so let this dry and let me show you how to package it now the lettuce is dry i'm going to start packaging it and this is a crucial point in the whole farming process is this last step here so this drying screen here of course dries the greens but also gives us an opportunity to uh go through and use it for quality control purposes so i know this is probably a job that you want to pass off to someone else pretty quickly in your in your farming team but this is a very crucial part so make sure that they're trained well they understand what's going on because when i'm looking here i'm looking for either rotten leaves any quality control as i said any weeds that might be in here bugs any of that sort of stuff because what's going off this into the bag is what the customer's getting so you want to take your time here and don't rush this too much and then when you go to package it for example for me here i'm selling a restaurant so most of my lettuce i put in these bags and i do two pounds as a standard bag size so i'll go through and grab all this and

about getting every last little bit out because then you'll be going with the next round but let me just show you the packaging here so this is definitely not two pounds but i have my scale over here teared out zeroed out and then i know how much the bag weighs and i guess as i said make sure you're going over the weight you never want to short your customers so once you get your two pounds what i do is i just leave a little bit of air sort of in the top like that and then i spin the bag and then use a rubber band here to close it up this is a very simple packaging that's worked well for me keeping the air in the top allows us not to get squished when you're packing in coolers and things like that if it's a different weight than two pounds i'll label it with a sharpie or anything like that and then i put it in the fridge back here so this whole process is going on at the same time i'm bubbling spinning drying and because i'm just packing off the back side here the flow works really really well so as i said in the last video you need to take time to think about the flow of materials and also how the people will move around so this is how i package it in two pound bags let me show you an older video clip where i package it in smaller bags just to show you guys here it's got a bag put the arugula in it we're doing five ounce bags today which is pretty common in like a supermarket you see five ounces because that's like roughly a third of a pound and you just want to make sure you give the customer at least that much if you go over a little bit i mean that was a lot over it's no big deal so you don't want to spend too much time finagling an ounce or two here there and then to get a nice bag what i like to do is hold the bag up towards the top and bunch it and we're trying to trap air inside here so when we spin it you can see we trap quite a bit of air in the top and then i use this bag taper here and there you go packaged arugula well when you're all done packaging for that either for the day or for that crop if you're switching over another crop the neat thing is because this will spin like this you can just smack the screen and most of the greens come right off and you're ready for uh for the next round let me jump in here real quick and take a minute to talk about our sponsor paper potco as i mentioned at the beginning of this module and in every module this entire course is sponsored by paper pot co this course wouldn't be possible without the help generosity and support of diego and paper potco and i really really appreciate that i know i say this all the time but their commitment to the farming community is just unparalleled they have great tools equipment and supplies over paperbot.com you should definitely go check it out they have awesome customer service and they are a reliable place to buy things from not just in terms of tools they also support the farming community in terms of education diego's a great content creator check out his youtube channel and also his podcasts like farm small farm smart in addition to all that there are extra resources for this course over at paperbot.com josh now back to the module [Music] talk for a few minutes about baby greens harvesting and washing here now you can harvest it with a harvest knife like one of those little knives like i showed you and if you do that a few times on any bit of scale you realize that it's crazy and it'll take too long you will get a more accurate harvest if you do it by hand so there are some times well i will go in my hand if i only need a few pounds or if i really don't have a lot and i really need to eek out that little bit but if i'm clearing whole beds or most of beds i'm going to lean on the greens harvester most of the time

here so this is definitely not two pounds but i have my scale over here teared out zeroed out and then i know how much the bag weighs and i guess as i said make sure you're going over the weight you never want to short your customers so once you get your two pounds what i do is i just leave a little bit of air sort of in the top like that and then i spin the bag and then use a rubber band here to close it up this is a very simple packaging that's worked well for me keeping the air in the top allows us not to get squished when you're packing in coolers and things like that if it's a different weight than two pounds i'll label it with a sharpie or anything like that and then i put it in the fridge back here so this whole process is going on at the same time i'm bubbling spinning drying and because i'm just packing off the back side here the flow works really really well so as i said in the last video you need to take time to think about the flow of materials and also how the people will move around so this is how i package it in two pound bags let me show you an older video clip where i package it in smaller bags just to show you guys here it's got a bag put the arugula in it we're doing five ounce bags today which is pretty common in like a supermarket you see five ounces because that's like roughly a third of a pound and you just want to make sure you give the customer at least that much if you go over a little bit i mean that was a lot over it's no big deal so you don't want to spend too much time finagling an ounce or two here there and then to get a nice bag what i like to do is hold the bag up towards the top and bunch it and we're trying to trap air inside here so when we spin it you can see we trap quite a bit of air in the top and then i use this bag taper here and there you go packaged arugula well when you're all done packaging for that either for the day or for that crop if you're switching over another crop the neat thing is because this will spin like this you can just smack the screen and most of the greens come right off and you're ready for uh for the next round let me jump in here real quick and take a minute to talk about our sponsor paper potco as i mentioned at the beginning of this module and in every module this entire course is sponsored by paper pot co this course wouldn't be possible without the help generosity and support of diego and paper potco and i really really appreciate that i know i say this all the time but their commitment to the farming community is just unparalleled they have great tools equipment and supplies over paperbot.com you should definitely go check it out they have awesome customer service and they are a reliable place to buy things from not just in terms of tools they also support the farming community in terms of education diego's a great content creator check out his youtube channel and also his podcasts like farm small farm smart in addition to all that there are extra resources for this course over at paperbot.com josh now back to the module [Music] talk for a few minutes about baby greens harvesting and washing here now you can harvest it with a harvest knife like one of those little knives like i showed you and if you do that a few times on any bit of scale you realize that it's crazy and it'll take too long you will get a more accurate harvest if you do it by hand so there are some times well i will go in my hand if i only need a few pounds or if i really don't have a lot and i really need to eek out that little bit but if i'm clearing whole beds or most of beds i'm going to lean on the greens harvester most of the time so this is a cool tool by farmer's friend you've\"}\n",

farmer's friend you've probably heard of this before it runs with a cordless drill essentially run this the blade spins back and forth in the front and the brushes throw the greens into the back and then you can dump this in a bin a couple of things about this is that it can be a dangerous tool and you have to be very very careful with it so train yourself train your staff the blade on this is super sharp and it's serrated and i cut myself with it one time and it was it was pretty brutal so just be very very careful with it in terms of harvesting it's pretty easy you just let the thing run and you kind of pull the harvester over the bed and you after a while you get a sense of the feel of it and how high you want to keep it above the bottom and depending how long the greens are too so if it got a little bit longer you probably want to hold it a little bit higher so you leave less stem growing there you can also use this to clear out beds before you flip the bed so if you have some baby greens that maybe isn't great for a second cut you can harvest it really low and then if you're curious how i flip baby green beds there's a previous module about that in the uh the no-till section so great tool uh absolutely crucial as i said for harvesting baby greens once you get them harvested i wash them the same way i wash lettuce so into the bubbler the spinner in the dryer and that all goes the same way [Music] now i'll talk about root crops and i'm gonna group these all together because they're pretty similar but for me it's gonna be mainly beets and carrots of course radishes and other things will fall into this category and one thing to do when you're harvesting is what's called thin harvesting so when you go out to harvest you just go through and you pick out all the largest ones and then you come back next week and there'll be some more large ones so you just keep doing that for several weeks i found that some beds are harvest off the same bed for weeks on end and just get a continual harvest and that's awesome and allow things to size up a little bit of course you can sell things smaller if your customers want them that way for example carrots my chefs don't want them too large so i have to harvest them when they're a little bit smaller that's kind of how they prefer them but there you go i usually harvest them into totes and the other thing you want to keep in mind about root crops is if your customers want the greens or if they don't want the greens so if i'm selling at a farmers market for example i probably want to leave the greens on generally people like carrots and beets with the tops on because they look fresh they're fun you're obviously getting to them pretty quickly so the greens will be in good shape i found that with chefs they don't want the greens with carrots so what i do is while i'm harvesting i will just twist the the greens off and keep the base of the you know the carrot with just a little bit of green on the top and i keep two bins out with me while i'm working and the greens go in one bin which goes in the compost and the carrots in the other bin i bring those in and wash them they liked a little bit of green on the end they they cook with it usually they're like roasting the whole carrot or maybe cutting in half as i said they like the smaller greens but if the smaller carrots but again whatever your customers want is what you should be delivering now with beets it's kind of both ways so i have a few beets here to show you at certain times of the year the greens look great and some of my chefs actually cook with these they'll make like a braising greens dish they'll mix with this with chard and kale and spinach and all sorts of stuff and they'll actually use this so they really like

enough shape or the customers didn't want it i would do the same thing i'd just bring out two bins and sort it out that way so what i've been doing here is i have been using just this sink here to clean them off and then put them on the drying screen here so let me give an example here of one that have the greens on so i'll just spray off the soil and then onto the drying the the screen here and i'll just lay them across as i go and after a while when this fills up i will put them on the rack which i talked about in the last module about the wash pack station so pretty straightforward process here if i'm just doing the root part like just the beet or just the carrot i'll just dump the whole bin with water into the sink and then just spray them all off and then put them on the drying screen and same process now this would be better if i had like a screen on the top then i could lay the roots down and spray through them we had that at raleigh city farm and it worked great i just haven't set it up here i also use this thing for multiple purposes so this has been working out okay i kind of just take my time and make sure it's nice and clean it's uh it's important to do

then you probably want to take all of this off and maybe even cut it just because this is the part that's going to rot the quickest so if you get it nice and dry and get in the fridge and wrap them up

about storage beets can be a good storage crop but you want to make sure and carrots but you want to make sure that you take off the any of the the greens on the top here otherwise these will rot and

this i'm really talking about things like kale swiss chard green onions those sorts of things i don't have that stuff growing on the farm here as i said my season's over but here are some clips showing you how to harvest that one thing i like to do is especially if you're sending a crew of people out or a helper or whatever or even yourself is get the number of rubber bands out for the number of bunches that you want ahead of time when i'm bunching i just forget i lose track trust me it's very hard to keep track of so if you need 10 bunches put 10 rubber bands on your hand or 20 count them before you get started then when you're out of rubber bands you're done harvesting super simple very effective i just keep them on these three fingers but you can put them on your wrist whatever works for you all right harvesting is pretty simple but one thing you want to keep in mind is that you're going to be letting this grow and getting multiple harvests out of it so you want to make sure you don't take too much off the plant but what you do is you go down to the outer leaves and you want to find the ones that are big enough that you'd like to harvest and you find them right here at the joint down here and you want to just snap it down and nice and clean and that's your leaf and you just work around the plant getting all the larger outer leaves or branches stems whatever and you want to make sure that you leave enough foliage in the middle that it'll regenerate and you can see down here that this plant's been harvested plenty you can see this nice thick stem here it's been harvested up and it's going to keep growing it's great so we're just going to go around here and try to get a bunch and you can make the bunches at whatever size that you want you just want to make sure that you're consistent as you're harvesting so i've got a bunch here and so what i like to do is i take a harvest knife you use any real knife and what i like to do is get a clean cut across the bottom here so that you get a nice finished package here like this this bunch is a little bit small but again it depends on what you're trying to solve for and everything and then i take a rubber band wrap it around and there you go there's your bunch of kale and the cool thing is it's all ready to go at this point and you got this nice clean look there looks very professional looks nice on a stand but uh yeah that's how you harvest it so when we're harvesting them it's pretty simple uh the other nice thing is uh you can thin harvest them right so you can take out the bigger ones leave the smaller ones for succession for next week or the week after so i usually harvest off of one bed for like a month obviously depends on what your demands are so uh let's pull out a bunch you want to keep as much of the soil here as you can and then i like to separate them because it's a lot easier to wash them that way i noticed if i leave it as one clump they're just impossible to wash so we

on saturday or sunday i'll text all the chefs that's how they like to be communicated with is over text and in the text message i'll text them individually don't send a group message i'll just say anything super brief about what's coming up or what's going on the farm what to expect usually a sentence or two and then i'll say gate orders in by monday delivery on wednesday and then i just list

certain restaurants and those those sorts of things generally they're pretty good about getting back to me if they don't because chef life is crazy if you've ever known a chef or worked with them you know it can get pretty crazy just send them a friendly reminder on the day that you need the order in and they're usually happy that you reminded them so if i don't hear from a chef by like mid to

done harvesting i wait till i actually finish the harvest because sometimes i don't have exactly what they want what they ordered so i obviously invoiced them for what what i had available for them and what i harvested and washed and packed and the finished weights and those sorts of things and what it does is emails uh the invoice them so they get a copy of it before i even show up the next day and then i print out two copies and i bring them with me and when i go do my deliveries i have them sign one and i and then i keep that and then they keep the other copy and they write me a check on the spot usually that's just how it works sometimes i can't find someone i get it the next week all my customers have paid me and haven't really been an issue but i know that can be the issue for some people so if you're not getting paid over and over again you may not want to work with them it may not be worth the headache but that's just how i do the invoicing and then i can i can use that check

or anything like that then there will be a charge but for me i just use checks because they're free for me there's no charge for square or for them i mean they have to write the check a lot of the

square it's 100 free and i just invoice the customers through square after i've done harvesting i wait till i actually finish the harvest because sometimes i don't have exactly what they want what they ordered so i obviously invoiced them for what what i had available for them and what i harvested and washed and packed and the finished weights and those sorts of things and what it does is emails uh the invoice them so they get a copy of it before i even show up the next day and then i print out two copies and i bring them with me and when i go do my deliveries i have them sign one and i and then i keep that and then they keep the other copy and they write me a check on the spot usually that's just how it works sometimes i can't find someone i get it the next week all my customers have paid me and haven't really been an issue but i know that can be the issue for some people so if you're not getting paid over and over again you may not want to work with them it may not be worth the headache but that's just how i do the invoicing and then i can i can use that check number and put that in square to double to um to reference that so i have a record of it and it's pretty simple that's just how i've been doing it uh if you do use electronic payments like credit card or anything like that then there will be a charge but for me i just use checks because they're free for me there's no charge for square or for them i mean they have to write the check a lot of the restaurants that i work with they have a checkbook around anyways because they're doing cod for alcohol

get in the swing of it so after you've got all that sorted out i want to talk about delivering because you we spend all this time harvesting in the right time of the day washing packing getting in the cooler all the stuff to help with shelf life but then we want to make sure we get it that last couple miles to our customers so let me show you that now i definitely use coolers to transport all my products i had a minivan for last time i have a truck now but either way these work great i bought six of these coolers i bought them at bj's there's nothing unique about them um but i like to get matching ones so they'll work well i like to put ice packs inside the cooler to keep everything nice and cool these ice packs are incredible they're very thin and they take up a lot of surface air in the bottom they'll stay cold for days and they stack really well in the freezer i absolutely love these i invested in them they were a little pricey but i was using like disposable ones and all sorts of stuff that leaked these have been bomb proof i love these one thing to point out though is that when you're putting ice packs in your cooler and you're putting veggies on them especially greens if the greens touch it they'll freeze the greens and then they'll damage them and ruin them so i often used to put a towel down over this to keep it separated but these are so cold that i needed another layer so what i've been using are these like daisy trays which you've probably seen before i'm sure lots of things you can use put this over the ice pack and then i put my towel in here and then i put my bags of greens in here i can put uh like six of those two pound bags in here sometimes seven uh so you do 12 and 14 pounds of lettuce i load these up and then i put them in the car they're really easy to move around inside the car and this keeps them super super cold of course the greens are all chilled because they're in the fridge overnight because they harvest it on tuesday and this transports them and keeps them in great shape [Music] if you are not selling to restaurants let's say you're doing farmer's markets or csas there's a couple more things i want to talk about here now if you're selling to a csa i don't have any experience with that but you want to be thinking more along the lines of how you put your boxes together and how much you can harvest for the week so generally your bunch sizes and stuff will be like how much you harvested that week divided by the number of boxes that you have and you'll be figuring out that way you also think about the refrigeration needs how you're getting things to the customers how they like it packaged if they want the greens if they don't want the greens you're really there to you know on root crops you're really there to service your customers and get them exact what they want so you want to keep that in mind now if you're selling to a farmer's market you'll really want to think about the package sizes that you're making because you don't want to be like making a lot of things different prices and stuff for the farmers market or the size that you choose when your packaging should reflect the prices so you'll have to put a lot of thought into that and think about when you're bagging greens or bunching root vegetables and picking the sizes depending on how you're going to sell them one model that works really well for a lot of farmers is like selling one item for three dollars two items for five dollars it makes the transactions really really smooth when i went to visit jesse last year i did a great video with him about selling a farmer's market i'll leave that link down below so you guys can check that out there's a lot of great tips in there and this is the last module of the course so i

the turnout's gonna be today but either way i decided to just go for it we only have two more weeks left in the course so thanks for showing up if you're here i really do appreciate it um yeah so get some questions in we're going to be talking today about the wash pack station um and like usual we i'll chat for a few minutes um and then take questions about the wash pack station in particular and then i'll take general questions but we'll see how it goes today i'm really not sure when people are going to show up i know a lot of people are barbecuing and hanging out with friends and family and and all that stuff but all right so before we get into all that stuff uh again like usual just want to thank paperpodco for sponsoring the entire course and making it possible and i know say this in every video and in every live stream this course really wouldn't have come to fruition without their support um as you probably know every other farming course there's a fee for it and i'm not saying mine is better or worse than those courses i actually haven't seen most of them but uh you know for someone to put this much time and they expect to uh to get paid for it and that's what held me back this whole time about making the course was um not wanting to charge for it because i don't think this information should be behind a paywall so huge thanks to them again go check what they have for sale tools equipment and supplies and i have an um i wanted to also let you know if you're tuning in that diego told me that the um the jinx cedar is back in stock so there was a supply issue for like everyone in the whole country it just wasn't there wasn't any available so he has some now they're available so if you're looking to buy one definitely go check that out and as i said in some of the modules they're also selling a little kit that comes with the rollers that i use which is pretty fun so you can order like the josh satin kit which i think is really uh is really cool so anyways that i just want to let you know about that um and again if you haven't already please thank them for uh for sponsoring this and making this happen i think they'd appreciate hearing from you so thanks for coming today um let's get some questions in here uh just a little bit of an update i did my last delivery almost two weeks ago so the farm is now closed for the summer we started putting the beds to

wanted to document it and share but essentially we cleared what we could we laid down some leaf mold that we made hopefully if you see that video from the fall we made about a big pile of leaves uh or maybe was over the winter i can't remember and then uh we added a little bit of that a little bit of commercial compost wet it down covered with the tarp put it to sleep for the summer so when we uh when we pull the tarp off it should be broken down ready to go and uh no weeds so that'll be awesome and it's just like i don't have to think about it i don't have to deal with it it's just it's just

possible um and yeah i just went through all the details i could find and all the stuff is linked in the video but um really breaking that down and the thing i wanted to stress about the wash pack station is taking your time to build it before you need it because once you need it you're super busy and you don't have time to do it so really think about the flow of the work the the wash pack station if you're in there by yourself it's going to be different than if you have people in there also keep in mind as your farm grows you probably will be adding more people if you are expanding your farm and think about how that works with how people move around how material moves around cold storage is really important and all that kind of stuff in the design of the wash pack station because i put a lot of thought into it and i'm really really happy with how it is now it's super super efficient and allows me to really um crank through the produce as quickly as possible especially myself which i've been very upfront about being a part-time farmer and needing time for youtube and videography and my other youtube channel and all that stuff is that i can't spend any extra time washing and packing vegetables that has to go as quickly as possible so in the next module uh which is going to come out on thursday is really like it's kind of a longer module it's all about washing packing storing um selling invoicing like all those details in one video which i've shared before but it's nice to have it all in one package and it's been really um i don't think i've processed yet the fact that i'm wrapping up the course i've been working on this project for so long now it's been taking a lot of time so um yeah anyways i'll probably reflect on that at some point uh i'm not there yet but yeah the last module's ready to go and that'll be up on thursday so all right uh enough chitter chatter let's see here viking patriot thank you so much for the kind words um i've gotten a lot of good feedback from the course i know it's interesting and probably frustrating for some people that i turn the comments off in the video so i don't really have feedback other than people coming to live streams or sending me a dm or an email so um but from everyone who's like had checked it out everyone's been pretty happy with it so there's a lot of hours uh there's a lot of hours i don't i should friday add it up it's probably at least 10 hours of video maybe more i don't know and every lesson is pretty dead so i appreciate that thanks so much hey simeon uh all right here's a question uh what do you think about not washing your head lettuce i know jesse said that sometimes he doesn't to help with uh with mold so it depends on your sales outlets and it depends on what your lettuce looks like so i'll give you an example here i'll get back to lettuce in a second but like i was growing full-size red russian kale and i did not wash that because it was just too much of a pain because washing those big leaves getting them dry enough is really really hard um because you can't just like throw it in the salad spinner throw on the drawing screen so it's like it's too much i was growing in tunnels and most of the year i don't use the overhead i've been using drip more and more so it's pretty clean now if it's covered in bugs i probably wouldn't sell it anyways so for me i was selling it as is i was just careful about handling it and keeping it clean and then i would just tell my chefs hey like i didn't wash this and they they they knew that most of the produce they gets not washed so the fact that like i wash my lettuce is a huge advantage uh for them because they don't have to wash themselves it takes a lot of time and energy so back to head lettuce though if

huge amount of time like and especially with head lettuce it's really hard to dry it so it's easy to wash right because you can just kind of dunk it in your tank and turn the bubbler in for a second or whatever if you have a bubbler if not you know you can spray them out pretty easily but then how do you dry them and so if you put them in the fridge wet then their shelf life is going to go down pretty quickly um if you're selling to restaurants and they're using within a few days maybe it doesn't matter so much you have to talk to them about it uh if you're selling to a farmer's market um yeah think about how it's gonna store you know if you one of the benefits of people that are buying produce from you locally is that they're getting it when it's super fresh and it lasts a long time so if people are buying stuff and they take it home and it only lasts for two days they're gonna be upset so i know that like one big selling point about my products is that they last a long time because they're use usually harvested the day before and they don't have to ship across the country so anything to do to help with shelf life but again if you can get away with it man you're gonna save yourself a lot of time so it's always a consideration and the biggest question always with any business any sales is it's all about your customers so you gotta think about what they want i think that's uh the bigger question now if the lettuce is like dirty and gross like definitely should clean it i mean it's it's really a uh a thing you need to consider and time of year might be different also one thing that can keep your lettuce cleaner is using landscape fabric and planting into holes if you want to do that i know ray tyler switched to that even inside of his tunnels last time i talked to him about this was a little while ago because he said the lettuce is just cleaner coming off the field that was inside a tunnel he said even they took away the landscape fabric and then the wash station was complaining because it would they were it was dirty and it was taking them longer to clean it so there's a lot of options it's kind of like what does it look like what does your product look like and and what your customers think about i think those are the biggest questions so long long answers in the end but uh all right what are your local health department regulators for washing or not washing so um this varies everywhere so i can't speak on what's going on for you the way i understand most places is that if you are not processing your food in any way so you're not cooking it fermenting it um anything like that then you're basically selling raw vegetables and so there's not much like there's not much regulation about it now that being said depending on where you're selling it to so for example some restaurants or some supermarket i haven't had a restaurant ask me this but some supermarkets they might ask for gap certification which is a certification process for your wash station and how you wash and clean your store your vegetables and stuff so if that's the case then there'll be more regulation but generally speaking and i can't speak for wherever you are um and and everywhere else that it really is generally pretty unregulated for vegetables once you get into meat you get an eggs um you get into having a commercial kitchen on your property you're fermenting things that's when you have more of an issue but if you're just like selling carrots and lettuce and stuff like that it's it's pretty low key i haven't had any uh anyone sort of checking on that or anything like that or i didn't have to apply for a license or anything because again i'm just selling like raw vegetables okay not a lot of questions today kind of expected

a lot of options it's kind of like what does it look like what does your product look like and and what your customers think about i think those are the biggest questions so long long answers in the end but uh all right what are your local health department regulators for washing or not washing so um this varies everywhere so i can't speak on what's going on for you the way i understand most places is that if you are not processing your food in any way so you're not cooking it fermenting it um anything like that then you're basically selling raw vegetables and so there's not much like there's not much regulation about it now that being said depending on where you're selling it to so for example some restaurants or some supermarket i haven't had a restaurant ask me this but some supermarkets they might ask for gap certification which is a certification process for your wash station and how you wash and clean your store your vegetables and stuff so if that's the case then there'll be more regulation but generally speaking and i can't speak for wherever you are um and and everywhere else that it really is generally pretty unregulated for vegetables once you get into meat you get an eggs um you get into having a commercial kitchen on your property you're fermenting things that's when you have more of an issue but if you're just like selling carrots and lettuce and stuff like that it's it's pretty low key i haven't had any uh anyone sort of checking on that or anything like that or i didn't have to apply for a license or anything because again i'm just selling like raw vegetables okay not a lot of questions today kind of expected but good to see everybody here so let me know if you have\"}\n",

let me know if you have questions i'll take general questions right now too so anything you want to talk about for uh catching me in a quiet live stream today uh one thing i do want to clarify about the module was um i said uh you spent at least 50 to 70 percent of your time washing vegetables that's not not true it's probably including harvesting you probably spend that much time so i definitely wanted to uh to clarify that yeah we're all just in summer mode yeah for sure i think uh it was one thing i was concerned about the course was getting it done as quickly as possible um in that people are in summer mode like i noticed like on youtube there's less views on a lot of videos and not just mine but other peoples and stuff people are out doing stuff they're not hanging on watching things and i think most of the time when people are learning about youtube is or learning about gardening and farming is like from like january or february through like may that's like the busiest time from that i found on youtube so everyone else is out doing stuff so totally totally get it um but the good thing is all the course will stay up so even if you didn't get a chance to finish it or you missed some modules you can watch it in the in the winter or whenever i actually did check with my state cannot sell root veggies and squash without a license oh oh i can sell okay yeah yeah eggs lettuce i'm interesting okay well good thing you checked um i know like when i was selling eggs there was some regulations uh like if you're under a certain dozen per per week or whatever um and then there's like rules about labeling and stuff i'm sure it varies in every different state or county or whatever interesting okay so you don't need a license to sell root veggies but lettuce you do i don't know micro greens you don't even watch micro green well i guess some of them you do i don't know that's really interesting all right hey andrew uh we're having issues with our baskets coming over washing machine salad spinner while spending yes okay so i addressed this in the washing machine spinner video that i made and i just put a couple of small pieces of pvc um and i screwed those in around the top i did like four so definitely check out the video it's called like diy salad spinner washing machine or something like that and that allowed me to like like press the basket in and it holds it in one of the issues with um the basket at least the one i have is that it's tapered so after it gets loose it just kind of wiggles itself out and also a lot of the washing machines are all different sizes in terms of the width so some if it's snuggly some it doesn't um i need to fix the little spacers that i have in there because they're getting a little bit loose they're still kind of working so i'm figuring out a new way to do that but i think some sort of like material that went around some sort of flexible tubing or pipe that you could get around the surface and attach it to the make like a ring and then you could shove the basket in there you want to make sure it fits pretty snugly and nice and tight because if you rip that if you start that's watching machine up it's going to work its way out and getting kind of dangerous so yeah that's what i'd recommend is put something around the top and if you check out the video that's one idea it did it worked pretty well and then what happened is the screws start getting loose and the things start flapping around but i kind of hold them in place and just drop it in i'm probably gonna do a little bit of work on the wash station before i fire

for like 250 plus the basket so that's 300 or up to 600 um the sink the laundry sink was probably i don't know 150 200 bucks and then a couple box fans and some wood so yeah and all the plumbing i'm probably around a thousand i would say for my wash pack station um another scale so we're getting a little bit more but again like you don't need a brand new laundry sink um you could hunt around for

you want to spend 2500 on a salad spinner when you can build one for 300. to me it's probably worth um putting the time in to build that right because that's a lot of money so um no i never actually don't think i answered that but again you depending on what you're watching like if you're not doing greens you don't need a you don't need the whole washing spinning situation um but if you are doing

go there's a lot of information out there i just as i said i haven't practiced it so i don't have too much to add on it but one thing about i'll talk about certifications for for a minute just in general if you are certified gaap or you are certified organic those are things that can only really help you in terms of sales now it could take a lot of time money energy whatever to get those things going and can keep them consistent but i know for example when i went to visit jesse and he is an organic certified organic farm when he goes to the farmer's market he said that's a huge advantage because most of the farms if not all the farms are not certified organic at his farmers market so when people come up and say hey is your farm certified organic he said yes that's a much easier sale for him and in fact the day i was there and when we made that video someone came up and said are you certified organic i don't think i could find another one and i don't know if there was another one at that time again it might really depend on your farmer's market but that can help a lot so um yeah i wouldn't if you think you might need gap certification and you're looking to build your farm or build your watch station i think it'd be worth it to look into the regulations and guidelines so that you might think you need to get into that zone it's a lot easier to just set yourself up for success and growth now than you don't have to do it later especially if you're in the middle of a million other things so always good to sort of think about that stuff again it comes down your sales outlets during your market research and those things okay so definitely i'll take any general questions today i know it's there's not a ton of people here which is fine um and uh i'll get back to grilling and i'll start grilling a little bit later tonight um but again just want to thank the sponsor paperbotco for sponsoring the entire course and diego's been super supportive uh in in a lot of ways and he also wanted me to mention that the jing cedar is now back in stock so if you're looking to pick one up and it's been back ordered for i think a few months now it's in stock he wanted me to let everyone know there uh all of you know that that it's in stock so if you want that it's there so and definitely go check out diego's podcast and his youtube channel and definitely say hello say thanks for uh for supporting the course and the farming community very cool oh man yeah i was just looking back at this comment i skipped over this dollar piece for squash yeah that's that's awesome yeah once squash get cranking they put out so much fruit it's pretty unreal all right more questions hopefully you guys are in your season and cranking away it is uh man just reminded every summer how much it kicks my butt as i get older i don't know about all you but summer's brutal uh thanks weekend film company uh let's see here uh thoughts on compostable seed starters so i've never used them i

maybe that you're not buying plastic trays and and nothing maybe it's made out of some sort of renewable resource and then it gets getting broken down into your soil i'd probably recommend going for soil blocks at that point because the trays you don't even have to have trays you could use a piece of wood if you wanted to you could i mean you could make soil blocks with anything and then there's no plastic really being used because you're just you buy that one piece of metal for the the soil block machine and then you just make it out of potting mix and then you don't have to worry about things breaking down your soil what's that what's that's doing to the the soil biology and ecology and all that stuff so i'd say um i probably wouldn't recommend them in general um again i haven't

those are my thoughts bag closures so for the big bags i just wrap a rubber band around them i'm gonna go over that in the module on thursday um yeah i just sort of keep a little bit of air in the top and then twist the background to keep some air in there and then wrap a rubber band around it that's what i've been using and then for smaller bags like when i was doing bags for farm stand sales or home deliveries i was doing like five ounce bags and so i was using a bag taper which i show if you if you don't wait till thursday you can watch there's a video called lettuce from field to farm stand where i talk about that and show that so again that's from uline it's like a little machine that holds like a roll of tape and you just kind of like put the bag through it and it like puts that little like blue orange whatever like little piece of tape with the like the flag that's sticking out so that's how you do that those are the two that i probably recommend the thing about the bag tapers though they're really um awesome for the people that are packaging them because it's super fast but they're a pain in the butt for the customer so that's the one negative because if you've ever had a bag like that you wind up like ripping the bag open because you get frustrated trying to get that little piece of tape off there so that's something to consider you could go with twist ties i

there's more and more uh demand for it i also think um that during covid especially in 2020 the first year man like there was not enough local food there was not enough food on the shelves like you go to the store and some of the shelves are empty in terms of produce meat we all know that we've all experienced that and i know a lot of people were really itching to get a csa share i know that everyone i know that had csa farms in 2020 sold out with a waiting list so i think the demand is there i'm just hoping that that like realization about like how fragile our food system is and supply chain is across the united states that people think more locally and even grow a little bit of their own food or buy some eggs from their neighbors or anything like that just kind of keep things a little bit more local i think is important once you get into the sustainable part of it i think that um that's where that follows but really for that to work you have to be a sustainable business and i think that's a big part of what i try to teach on my channel on this course is that for these farms we can get all nerdy about soil science and using compost and cover crops and inputs and we can talk about food nutrient density and pollinators and no pesticides and you know all this stuff no till like all the stuff that we talk about but if we're not making money as small-scale sustainable farmers then we're not going to be here very long so that's where i think it really has to come down to is like how do we get people educated about buying local food how to make sure the farms are profitable and a lot of that comes down for selling the food for a lot of money and this is where the rub comes for me a lot in that to make a living as a small scale farmer you need to charge a lot and then that food isn't necessarily available to the people that probably need it the most people that don't have a lot of money so this is like a bigger conversation that i've had a lot especially

things that go into selling seeds for sure i would definitely reach out to someone that does it or another option is if you're really interested in growing and developing strains you can sell your seeds to a seed company and not have to do all that work you can just produce the seeds of course you probably won't make as much money i'm not really sure maybe you'll be okay you could get in touch with one of those companies and and send them some stuff and might take a year or two till you get things underway and they accept what you're growing but i don't know there's possibilities there if you're interested in in developing seeds and stuff oh nice there you go yes southern exposure thanks rambler yeah i can't never remember the name of things like that um yeah it's um that was a really cool experience going there and they're really interesting places because they're actually an intentional community as well so um that was a crazy day i went to visit pam dowling at um at her place and then went over to uh southern exposure it was a it was a crazy day for me um yeah but they um they have a lot of great seeds there too oh i have no idea that's not my wheelhouse i can't really give you experience there but i would probably make sure that you're really comfortable with growing and harvesting seeds and that they're successful and that they're growing true and that you're getting good germination and all that stuff um i think those sort of endeavors take a lot longer and then the other thing you have to worry about is um like cross-contamination when you're growing seeds because you know you have to separate things pretty far there's a bunch of like technique and stuff i just don't know about um that you want to think about because you know if you're selling a

careful about that stuff so i just don't have the experience with it but hey i mean anything around i say this plenty of times like if you want to be in the farming space and help with this movement of small-scale farming you don't have to be the one growing the food there's other things in there that you can help with if it's starting seeds if it's more nurseries i think there's a demand for nurseries that do starts for people i know around here a lot of people use banner which is out i think in western north carolina or east tennessee and um i never use them but i know a lot of people that do you know creating starts for people making compost uh helping people with marketing web design um yeah there's so many things around the business that could help these farmers and you don't have to be the one farming you could even you know go and volunteer somewhere you could you know work somewhere part-time you could sell at a farm you could you know sell at a farmer's market for somebody there's a lot of ways to like help out in the farming community um you could try to convince your friends to buy from another farm i mean there's a lot of things you can do if you just want to get involved so i'm a little off track here oh nice yeah that's most people that are not into farming that is not their thing so and to your point uh drops that um i think that's a big part of farming is that the farmers who get into it really love growing and harvesting and tending the land but like the marketing and sales and business side of it is not their thing and so they just wind up not having a very profitable business the farmers that are really successful are the ones that have at least a little bit of business mindset in terms of sales and marketing and then they can crush it and then they have the food to back it up so all right\" metadata={'source': 'MIShwqRLm1k', 'text': \"to have you need to have like stands that go into stores and do they buy it from you ahead of time like what does that cost up front you have to sign packaging there's a lot of things that go into selling seeds for sure i would definitely reach out to someone that does it or another option is if you're really interested in growing and developing strains you can sell your seeds to a seed company and not have to do all that work you can just produce the seeds of course you probably won't make as much money i'm not really sure maybe you'll be okay you could get in touch with one of those companies and and send them some stuff and might take a year or two till you get things underway and they accept what you're growing but i don't know there's possibilities there if you're interested in in developing seeds and stuff oh nice there you go yes southern exposure thanks rambler yeah i can't never remember the name of things like that um yeah it's um that was a really cool experience going there and they're really interesting places because they're actually an intentional community as well so um that was a crazy day i went to visit pam dowling at um at her place and then went over to uh southern exposure it was a it was a crazy day for me um yeah but they um they have a lot of great seeds there too oh i have no idea that's not my wheelhouse i can't really give you experience there but i would probably make sure that you're really comfortable with growing and harvesting seeds and that they're successful and that they're growing true and that you're getting good germination and all that stuff um i think those sort of endeavors take a lot longer and then the other thing you have to worry about is um like cross-contamination when you're growing seeds because you know you have to separate things pretty far there's a bunch of like technique and stuff i just don't know about um that you want to think about because you know if you're selling a seed to someone you say hey this is this like heirloom purple carrot and they get it and it comes out a different color

season's over i had to sort of piece together the a lot of the video clips and stuff but it seems to work you guys will get the point um hey carrie and then that and then that'll be the last module and i have my last q a on on next monday and that'll wrap it up so pretty crazy uh my opinion of hydroponics is that what you're asking about so yeah i always get asked about hydroponics i personally don't have any interest in growing hydroponically not to say that it doesn't have a place in the world and doesn't have importance but for me i have access to soil and sunshine so i'm going to use that so that's sort of my approach to it i like the food grown in soil better than hydroponics again this is just personal preference are there places in the world where hydroponics is important yes there are places where high density places where it's really hard to get local food there's a lot of cool stuff going on with technology in terms of lighting and solar and nutrients and stuff like that but i think when we're trying to create living soil which is kind of the avenue that i like to take you can't really do that with in the same way with hydroponics it's just a different kind of vegetable that you're growing so that's just my personal preference i know there's a lot of cool stuff especially with aquaponics too and you know there's a lot of sustainable things that can happen with that as well just not my wheelhouse not personally interested so i don't really get into it but again there's a time and place for everything but i'd rather use the soil in the sunshine and that

welcome oh you're welcome carrie thanks for tuning in checking them out you're very welcome yeah so uh i don't remember when i talked i'm talking about in so many videos but there's nothing wrong with

sense financially and you like doing it and you have the sales and you want to then you can expand it but there's no problem with like setting up a farm a roadside stand or going to a farmer's market with a few things or selling to friends and family that kind of stuff so i grow all winter here um i don't grow i just turn my farm off for the summer so i live in north carolina so i don't yeah i

      "page_content=\"[Music] hey there welcome to module 18 of the satin hill farm course this module is all about the wash pack station and before we get into it i have to have a huge thanks to our sponsor paper pot co without the help of diego and peter podco this entire course wouldn't be possible and more on them later in this module i'll cover the importance of having a really good wash pack station i'll talk a little bit about plumbing of course my setup and all the different elements that i have going on in my wash pack station refrigeration and a few other things before we get into all the details of my wash back station here and of course we will get into all those details i want to first talk about the importance of not only having a wash pack station but the importance of having an efficient and streamlined wash back station now we all know that we have to harvest wash and pack our vegetables but a lot of people don't know is literally how much time mark gardner spend in their wash pack station so it's usually at least 50 of your time is spent washing and packing vegetables it can be even up to 70 so anything you can do to make it more efficient and more streamlined and save time and energy the more time energy you have to put on other things in your life so i spent a lot of time thinking about that in terms of how mine set up here and i'll talk about my design and efficiency and flow but keep in mind when you are designing your wash pack station you want to think about the workflow and how things are gonna be moving around but also how people are gonna be moving around so for me here i'm in my uh small two-car garage which never has cars in it anymore but i'm only using a fraction of it here i don't know the square footage i think it's maybe 35-40 square feet that you're looking at over here so it's not a lot but this is designed for me to work in by myself so if you have a crew or you might have a crew down the road you might have two three or more people working in your wash station you have to think about how it's going to work this is designed for one person here i literally i don't think i could have another person here now another thing i want to mention not only just in the design and layout which we will get into is you want to make sure that you do all of this you set up your wash pack station before you even get going on your farm this is a really common mistake people start building tunnels building beds planting stuff and then all of a sudden the season starts rolling in there's crops going off the field and they're like oh my how do i wash these so plan ahead at raleigh city farm this is something we did as soon as we could as soon as we you know could finalize our plans and get going we need to get our wash station up and rolling before we start pulling crops off the field because then you're not going to wash and pack them so make sure you you know have that all set up ahead of time another important part of the wash pack station is getting it out of the weather i think a lot of people try to just set things up outside but as soon as the summer rolls around and the heat's bearing down on you you want to be in the shade for sure having fans or if you can like for me in my garage here i have a window in the back so i have an air conditioning unit so in the summertime i can come in here and it stays pretty cool in the winter time i have a small space heater that i pull out and i can keep warm in here that goes a long way for your own personal comfort or and anyone that's working with you if you ever try to wash vegetables in the cold it's miserable especially in the heat too and not just for the people themselves but if it's really hot a lot of the vegetables will start struggling too so

looks good and you can do that that quality assessment so make sure you have good lighting in your washback station [Music] water is going to be super important in your wash pack station you're going to need a good amount of it and you're also going to need to be high quality and potable so you might have a different water source in your wash pack station than you have in your field of course the wash pack station might be in a different area so it might have a different water source but you can use different water for irrigation than you can for washing vegetables so here in the wash station i'm tied into my house water which is on our house well and this actually the water comes through here is through our house water filter system so separate from the irrigation setup where i have just a uh basic sediment filter i have a um you know a carbon filter and a sediment filter on my house so i use that just to sort of clean up the water a little bit but make sure it's potable make sure you have enough of it and of course if it's colder that's better so for me here like i said we're on our house well system even in the summertime the water is probably at most 50 or 55 degrees fahrenheit which is great for washing vegetables the colder the water the better uh so that you can bring down the temperature of the field heat we'll talk about more of that in the next module which is about harvesting so keep that in mind also if you're pulling in city water in the summertime especially in the south here i know our groundwater can if you're on city water can get up to 80 or 85 degrees fahrenheit of course if you're further south it's even warmer so having cool water some people even add ice to their wash station or instead of their bubbler just to keep it a little bit cooler so keep that in mind you don't want to have super warm water and you need to have good quality potable water for all of your washing needs [Music] now let's talk about plumbing both in terms of water coming into the wash station and draining out so this takes some planning and if you're not comfortable with plumbing just get someone to help you you can even hire a plumber but a lot of this is pretty basic you could probably take care of it yourself so of course where's your water coming in as i said it's coming from my house and so i have three quarter inch water lines all throughout my house so what i did was i ran a line back to the source right after the water comes into my house and after my water filters i ran a dedicated three-quarter inch line into my garage here because i wanted to have maximum water flow as i said part of the wash pack station is efficiency and one of the bottlenecks is filling up your bubbler so you're limited in how fast the water can come in so i recommend trying to get as much water into the wash station as possible and of course if you're doing a lot of root washing and spraying and stuff like that you're going to have a lot of pressure and a lot of volume so get them as much water as possible so for me it all comes in it's down here behind my bubbler and it comes up to this i have a little manifold here sorry this is all kind of messy

it'll keep you safe from getting shocked and all that sort of stuff if you don't have to do that again call an electrician but it's super important so sorry for all the messiness back here but basically i create these little manifolds i've done this at raleigh city farm too basically the water comes in here and then gets redirected out so right here this is what goes to my bubbler this here is another sprayer so i have a dedicated spray out for my greens bubbler and then i have water that gets sent over to the the laundry sink over here so having dedicated hoses hoses and sprayers are awesome i used to have just one hose for the whole wash pack station but this is great and especially if you have multiple people working you don't have to look for a hose or drag it across the you know the floor or whatever this literally is just here to spray this out super handy uh i really like that feature and not have to have you know all sorts of hoses getting dragged around and stuff all right so let's talk about the drainage so for me i have three elements that had to have drainage because i'm focused on washing greens in here mostly so i have a greens bubbler we have the salad spinner and then we also have over here the um the laundry sink and so these are all tied into one common drain system and so we're using a two inch pvc drain they all tie into which has been working great having a big drain is super helpful because one of the bottlenecks as i mentioned is the greens bubbler in filling that up but also draining it so the faster you can drain the greens bubbler the faster you can refill it so i wanted to put in a big drain and so all this is tied into just two inch pvc i made a detailed video about this when we built the wash station which i'll leave link down below if you want to see all the details if you need help with plumbing hire a plumber or get a friend to come over a lot of this is pretty simple but just think about where all the water is going to go and of course the wider the drain the faster it'll drain but also the less like it'll be to clog which is super important if you have chunky stuff or bits of lettuce or whatever that winds up getting down the drain it won't get clogged because you have a nice big opening and one addition to that is with this whole system is that i added a vent over here and this is just tied in this is an open piece of tubing that's tied in the bottom of the tee and that allows the water to float very quickly so just like with regular plumbing if you have a vent in there it allows smooth water smooth drainage and so we put that in and the drainage works great but one thing that's i just want to show you which is interesting you know we have a garage door here and as i mentioned we also uh don't have a floor drain so let me show you this little work around and how i made it happen to get the water out of here originally here at the farm i used one of those flat lay hoses that opens up when it fills up and i just ran under the garage door it worked okay sometimes it would take some finessing and i wanted a better solution for two reasons first of which is i wanted to be more robust and drain a lot faster but also i was dumping all the water into my driveway here which is winding up in one of our you know garden beds in front of our house and killing everything because you have to think about where the water is going to go so what we did is we ran this two inch pvc line this is the main drain so you can see right here this is where the uh the bubbler ties in and all the rest of the plumbing comes in from around the back of all this stuff and this gets directed out under my porch and away from the house and there's a downhill slope over there so again if you watch that plumbing video you'll see that but one thing here is i\" metadata={'source': 'pMhVFFYgsLY', 'text': \"me just say really quickly all this is plugged into a gfi outlet so if you don't have one of those

redirected out so right here this is what goes to my bubbler this here is another sprayer so i have a dedicated spray out for my greens bubbler and then i have water that gets sent over to the the laundry sink over here so having dedicated hoses hoses and sprayers are awesome i used to have just one hose for the whole wash pack station but this is great and especially if you have multiple people working you don't have to look for a hose or drag it across the you know the floor or whatever this literally is just here to spray this out super handy uh i really like that feature and not have to have you know all sorts of hoses getting dragged around and stuff all right so let's talk about the drainage so for me i have three elements that had to have drainage because i'm focused on washing greens in here mostly so i have a greens bubbler we have the salad spinner and then we also have over here the um the laundry sink and so these are all tied into one common drain system and so we're using a two inch pvc drain they all tie into which has been working great having a big drain is super helpful because one of the bottlenecks as i mentioned is the greens bubbler in filling that up but also draining it so the faster you can drain the greens bubbler the faster you can refill it so i wanted to put in a big drain and so all this is tied into just two inch pvc i made a detailed video about this when we built the wash station which i'll leave link down below if you want to see all the details if you need help with plumbing hire a plumber or get a friend to come over a lot of this is pretty simple but just think about where all the water is going to go and of course the wider the drain the faster it'll drain but also the less like it'll be to clog which is super important if you have chunky stuff or bits of lettuce or whatever that winds up getting down the drain it won't get clogged because you have a nice big opening and one addition to that is with this whole system is that i added a vent over here and this is just tied in this is an open piece of tubing that's tied in the bottom of the tee and that allows the water to float very quickly so just like with regular plumbing if you have a vent in there it allows smooth water smooth drainage and so we put that in and the drainage works great but one thing that's i just want to show you which is interesting you know we have a garage door here and as i mentioned we also uh don't have a floor drain so let me show you this little work around and how i made it happen to get the water out of here originally here at the farm i used one of those flat lay hoses that opens up when it fills up and i just ran under the garage door it worked okay sometimes it would take some finessing and i wanted a better solution for two reasons first of which is i wanted to be more robust and drain a lot faster but also i was dumping all the water into my driveway here which is winding up in one of our you know garden beds in front of our house and killing everything because you have to think about where the water is going to go so what we did is we ran this two inch pvc line this is the main drain so you can see right here this is where the uh the bubbler ties in and all the rest of the plumbing comes in from around the back of all this stuff and this gets directed out under my porch and away from the house and there's a downhill slope over there so again if you watch that plumbing video you'll see that but one thing here is i\"}\n",
      "page_content=\"this stuff and this gets directed out under my porch and away from the house and there's a downhill slope over there so again if you watch that plumbing video you'll see that but one thing here is i just made a short section of pvc plumbing pvc pipe with unions on them and i just unscrew these which is pretty simple and then the door can close so this is just a little solution that i came up with not to say this is like a great solution but i just want to show you that once you pull that out the garage door can close no problem i didn't have to put a hole in my garage door and this is how it looks with that little connector piece in there and also with the door down so to do this i just detach the garage door opener and put in manual mode and then just slowly lower it down and then when i'm done washing i'll pull it back up and take this out and then i can close the garage door all the way it does leave a little bit of a gap in the bottom and i've noticed in the summertime when it's super hot a lot of heat will get in that way so i think eventually i might even like figure out some way to close that gap with foam or wood or something so that it can stay a little bit more pleasant there while i'm washing but this is how it works it's a it's a little bit of work around but it's working out so there are a lot of clever ways to do this but think about how your water is getting out of your wash station and where it's going you don't want to just dump it everywhere because this tank will hold a lot of water and when that goes out you know you could cause damage to things if you don't have a dedicated space for it so just think about the water coming in how you're gonna redirect it around your wash station to all the different elements and then of course how you get it out of here [Music] as i said this is designed really for just me to be working in here so the different elements we have the greens bubbler the salad spinner and the drying screen and then we have a sink in the back so in terms of this being set up for me personally and one person i'll fill this up with water add the greens bubble them transfer them over to the spinner and then take the basket dump it on the drying screen and while that's all going on i'll be on the other side of the drying screen packing off so let's go through all these details the first element of the wash station is the greens bubbler now each of these pieces is crucial to the operation but the greens bubble are super cool for a lot of reasons now traditionally in small farms and market gardens they would have three basins of water they dump it in the first then they transfer the product to the second and then transfer to the third and each succession it'll get cleaner you've probably seen triple washed labeled on bags in the supermarket and things like that so that's where that came from but the greens bubbler kind of allows you to do this all in one step which is why it's so great and it's very effective so i had a smaller one before this is i think 110 gallon tank i will try to leave links down below for everything i can think of that i've used in this but uh this is a bigger tank which i like a lot i think originally i was using like a 70 or 75 gallon tank but having a bigger tank allows you to wash more at once but even if you put in the same amount on every um rotation it allows more of the more action and allows the the greens and stuff to move around more and get clean better so this is this is fantastic now a couple things about my bubbler this uh was a kind of a prototype that i was working with farmer's friend on last year or two years ago and they sent me some stuff to try out so there's a lot of stuff in this bubbler that i'm not really happy with but like i said before once you get rolling on the farm and you're in your season it's hard to stop and and work on your wash station so i've been rolling with it so i will show you kind of

there and then you have a way to bring in water so those are all the elements so let me go through and show you what i got going on here as i said i'm not super happy with it but it's been working but hopefully give you some ideas about how to how to do this here's what it looks like inside the bubbler and we have this manifold which is a combination of pvc and vinyl tubing with holes in it you have to experiment with the holes and the number of holes and the size of them to make sure you get the right flow so give it a try this all comes apart which is great because i can clean it i can soak it i can do whatever i want but the one thing i don't like about this system is they had the idea of putting the air coming in from below they didn't want to have anything like in your way this made this way more complicated for a bunch of reasons i don't need to get into and i would definitely recommend that you bring the air in this is the the blower in the back here this is the blower that goes underneath and up i definitely would say that it's a lot simpler to just bring the airline into here and just deal with that obstruction it just simplifies a lot i'll just say that so definitely don't go through the bottom like this but again i was i was working with farmers friend to work on a prototype and uh so that's what i have right now i'm just kind of working around i'll probably change this in the future and just to show you another design of a manifold this is the original one that i had in my other system and this is where it attached with a union to the blower this worked great i had zero complaints about this setup and again it's just something simple as i said like a manifold that goes along the bottom with a bunch of holes in it i will leave links down below for all of the different setups of wash stations that i've had over the years i'll leave those videos linked down below but again this is not super crucial just make sure you have coverage along the bottom and some holes and i like the ability to take it apart and clean it so just give you another another idea here bringing water in is as i said is important because you need the water in the tank but also bring it in quickly and one thing that i recommend is having this here this is what's called a hudson float valve this is actually i think it comes with a one inch thread but i just adapted a three quarter here of course if you have one inch line you guys can figure all the stuff out this is great because as the water fills up in here it'll shut the water off which is super important for a few reasons one is you always get a consistent fill so once you figure out the level of water that works in your system you'll have the same level all the time also you can turn this on and walk away and not have this thing overflow this has saved me so many times and just made the whole thing run so much more efficiently highly recommend the hudson flow valve but not very expensive now the drain on the bottom is something else that i want to talk about i don't like this drain either because there's a little bit of a lip here and so it's hard to get all of the if there's any like bugs or dirt or anything that comes off the greens which this is why you're washing them it's really hard to get them out i have yet to find a good solution for this where you can get a flush drain so again this is not one that i'd recommend but like usual you know i'm just showing you guys stuff that i use but give you some ideas i don't think there is a perfect way to do this i

doesn't go through the whole thing and there's a drain on this which i mentioned before which ties into that whole two inch system over here we have a timer which is awesome this one i just set it to how many minutes i usually run it for six or seven minutes per cycle and it gets most of the water out and the reason why i have it up high like this is that it keeps it dryer if there's any spray or

different things first of all let's talk about what this is this is basically a simple 2x4 structure with three box fans on the top that blows air through the greens there is i think it's quarter inch hardware cloth on the bottom here there's no specific design here just kind of whatever works the neat thing here is that as i said i put a light under here which really helps me see what's going on under here unless you have really bright lights in in your area but this has been helpful the other thing is that it rotates in the middle so we have just a bolt with a nut going through there it allows it to pivot and it's pretty tight so i don't have to like lock it in place or anything uh this this is great and for the reason that i have this is that when you're done you can turn this like this smack the bottom and all the greens fall out and you're good to go for the next round especially important if you're switching between like you're watching you know baby kale arugula and you have to go to lettuce you want to dump that out get all the material out and then start your next round or if you're at the end of the the whole cycle and you want to get everything off of there super easy to do that sweep it up get the greens out of here now this doubles for two things first of all it gets the water off and that's again helps with keeping the greens to last a lot longer but the other thing is it's sort of like a sorting screen or a quality control area so once all the greens are laid out here you can easily see what you're doing because of course the light but it's also spread out so this is the last step in quality control i can look through and if there's anything that looks you know bad or not up to your par you can pull that out and then we'll package this off here onto

and equipment module you have a good scale i really like this touare one it's a little pricey totally worth it um yeah you don't want to short your customers it needs to be reliable you know that's one thing you don't want to waste time on is your is weighing things out especially if you're using small quantities you want to be quick and accurate for packaging i use one bag this is one i get i get these from uline because i'm selling to restaurants i only kind of sell in larger quantities i use one bag and then i put a rubber band around the top i have a sharpie here to label how many pounds in there if it's not something standard this is the whole setup so keep it really simple don't keep a lot of clutter around just keep what you need it keeps it streamlined and simplified

want to be quick and accurate for packaging i use one bag this is one i get i get these from uline because i'm selling to restaurants i only kind of sell in larger quantities i use one bag and then i put a rubber band around the top i have a sharpie here to label how many pounds in there if it's not something standard this is the whole setup so keep it really simple don't keep a lot of clutter around just keep what you need it keeps it streamlined and simplified [Music] the last element of the wash station in terms of wet work is the the sink here this is a double wide laundry sink i got this at lowe's it was pretty inexpensive and it ties into the whole drainage system and as i mentioned before we have it own dedicated hose and drop for this so i have a ball valve over here to turn on and off and i have a sprayer here so this just it lives in here for this so that's really easy as a separate thing i\"}\n",

them on the drying screen which is right next to it here so it's super handy i also use this to spray out totes and other stuff like that so having a general like wash sink is good especially if you're doing roots you're gonna need somewhere you can spray things off a lot of people will do have they'll do this outside and they'll just have like a table with screen on it and they'll just spray it and the water will go through that's another great solution you don't deal with drainage and all that kind of stuff but for me especially with the heat here in the summer and you know if it gets really hot and i have to wash vegetables of course in the winter time wet work outside is miserable so keep being inside is handy this is my solution for that it's pretty inexpensive and is very versatile you'll definitely need some refrigeration on your farm for a couple reasons the biggest one is after you're done harvesting washing and packing your vegetables you need a place to store them before you either go to your farmers market or you're going to be making your deliveries and usually this is something that people don't think about a lot because sometimes it can be a pretty big expense the best thing i'd recommend is a walk-in cooler of some sort so you can do that by either building sort of a false room and then insulating it there's lots of videos online about i've never done it personally and using a cool bot and an air conditioner and the cool bot controls the air conditioner allows you to keep it cool in there that's a great option another one is if a restaurant is closing or you can sometimes find these deals on commercial walk-in fridges where the air compressor is or the compressor on the air conditioning unit has died you get a pretty good deal on it then retrofit it with an um cool bot and air conditioner that's another option at raleigh city farm we had a insulated trailer that we used with a cool button air conditioner that worked great i wasn't there for the build process but it's something we had and the way you could move around the farm or if you're moving from one farm to the next there's a lot of options out there what i've used is this small commercial walk-in cooler and this is not really an ideal solution but it's been working out for me and like i said with everything i'll just show you what i've been using so this here i got it really cheap from some guy locally i don't know this thing is ancient but it still runs it's fine and one thing about it is that i only turn it on usually one day a week so i'll turn it on the day i'm harvesting and then i deliver the next day so i turn it off it only runs one day a week unless i have stuff in here that needs to be cooled all the time if i'm constantly harvesting you know things like cucumbers or squash or something that needs to be harvested you know every day or two then i'll have it running but most weeks i just have it off and uh just turn on that one day so really saving electricity two things this is good for of course after you're done washing and packing your veggies you need to store in here but also when you're coming off the field and you're doing all your harvesting so for me i don't have a crew here so i do all my harvesting and then i wash the nice thing is i can move all these shelves around and stuff i also can put my harvest bins right in here so when i'm harvesting i'll bring everything off the field put in the fridge have it start cooling down and then when i'm done harvesting i can transition over to washing so again this has been working

sometimes depending on how much i'm harvesting that week but if you run out of room over and over again think about getting more space think about how you can keep things in bins because that really simplifies your life when you're harvesting you pull it right off put in the fridge especially in the summer time when you're trying to get the field heat off if this farm got any bigger than this i'd probably have to invest in another one of these or maybe another solution but for now this has been working just wanna show you what i have going on the farm here [Music] this is also a really cool piece of equipment in the wash back station this is just a wire rack on wheels and this is what i used to use for my grow lights and doing micro greens and starts in here before i had a nursery and it doesn't have to be this size this one is a two foot by four foot wide one i kind of think the bigger the better but the best thing is that it's on wheels and it has a lot of different shelves on it which is fantastic so what i use this for is generally after i wash my root vegetables and they put them on the drying screen for a few minutes they'll go on here to continue drying while i wash my greens and so it just gives me more time for them to dry out and then i can pack off of it pretty easily so i'll just lay out carrots or beets on here and kind of let them dry if you are a little bit more in a hurry i think one cool thing would be to put a couple fans on the top here to try to blow some air through give you just extended drying space uh as you're doing that but this is fantastic gives you a lot of flexibility and i want to make one other point here is that if you are your wash pack station is you have a poured floor cement floor something like that anything on wheels is great because you can move things around especially at different times of the year when you're harvesting different kinds of vegetables gives you some flexibility this something like this uh i i if i had a bigger wash station i probably have a bunch of these they're super super handy well hopefully this gave you some good ideas if you're looking to build a new wash station or maybe improve your

the region and we are working on approximately 90 hectares and we have a mixed system so we have a arable fields we have some grassland for our horses but we also have a Market Garden where we grow vegetables we also have agroforest systems and here you can see in the background we are now standing in an agroforestry system as we also call the wind hatch or soil protection hatch or even multifunctional hex and what we we are doing here is we're doing research and demonstration we use a series of different agroecological methods here on the farm so we start with converting to organic in 2006 then we have a wide crop rotation that we use we Implement cover crops we conduct reduced tillage so we work as a standard method only four centimeter deep on our farm with our tillage tools we use mixed seeds nowadays lentil barley and Fields Flex for example or chickpeas and and Fields flags for example what we established over the years is a A reduced tillage methods like four centimeter deep only but this is only possible if you reduce your tire pressure for example so we adapted our we can adapt our tire pressure easily with a very simple very cheap method it's only 250 euro and and you have the same results as you get from a five thousand or seven thousand Euro unit so we reduce we try to have a light weighted tractors use our main tractor only has 100 horsepower and it's four tons and and we still can do the the 90 hectares on the farm we always try to implement cover crops as soon as possible and as much as possible and we try to reduce the crops that produce animal fodder and we try to increase the crops that produce human food so so these are all things that where we where we where we try to increase biodiversity where we try to adapt for climate change where we try to mitigate climate change and uh to to do positive things on society and and on the planet with agroforest it's quite a super interesting system because what we look at Grant Farm we are searching for sustainable systemic Solutions and agroforestry is a very good example on that when you put what does it mean agroforestry in my understanding it's bringing back uh Park bushes and trees in in the arable land so here in our area we have have very good arable land but there is a lack of structure so there there is a lack of trees it's only only Fields so what we did is we planted 1.3 kilometer of this agroforestry strips and what we can see is a systemic approach so what we do is we we collect we suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere with these a photosynthetic from the plant and we store the carbon in the wood and in the soil we reduce erosion so wind and water can no longer blow away or wash away the soil we adapt to climate change because when these trees grow up we have heavy winds here in our region and that reduces the wind speed and when you have reduced wind speed you also have reduced evaporation so we save water on the on the fields nearby when we have an agroforestry system installed in the in the in the location but we also reduce or stop the loss of biodiversity because in this area you have to imagine the trees and the bushes the flowering so you get all the beneficial insects you get all the pollinators here they have a habitat and they we provide food at the same time and the same is true for for wild animals like birds or or other animals which have a habitat here and also food so it's a very systemic approach but we also want to see an economic benefit from this area so we will put laying hands in here to produce eggs

on 11 out of 17 sustainable development goals so that's huge so but why why does that happen because yes we are producing organic vegetable healthy fresh for the for the local region but we also creating jobs we are also mitigating climate change here on this land we are adapting to climate change we are regenerating our soil we are making a healthy clean water we are helping to to have clean air we are creating jobs we are putting initial we are starting initiatives in the local region in the rural area we are bringing back young people into the rural area we are reducing the average age in agriculture with when bringing in young people we try to explain to people to decision makers to the society what we do here what is the potential that such a system has on Society on the planet on the environment but also show the challenges that are such a system brings with you so the challenge of know-how for example you need a lot of know-how to to make it successful and we are still here not profitable just from the production side but we are we are planning to be profitable next year and we are really seeing the development and and and and and the improvements that we are making here with uh together with a great team of young professionals professional gardeners yeah here we can see the the typical soil that we have here in this region and it's a channel same and here you can see the top soil which is quite quite high it's about 25 30 centimeter and here is the subsoil but still people think subsoil is not important it's super important as you can see there are Roots everywhere and even if you consider this is uh is a burrow from an earthworm and it's covered with the biohumus with the casting from the earthworm so you see the different color from the subsoil which is quite bright to the dark air area where the the earthworm compost the earthworm casting is growing and here you can see such an earthworm casting which was penetrated by plant roots and you see how the plant roots develop and how they grow into the into the earthworm Birds they really enjoy this area because they find everything that they need they find more water they find more nutrients more microbes so this is really important still this soil was compacted because here this was a kind of driveway where we brought water in so we had a trailer with six eight tons and so this area is quite compacted and therefore I want to show you just nearby on the right side where we have plants grown pepper and Tahini and we had a mulch a layer of organic mulch which was a Lucerne hay or which is Lucerne hay and I want to show you the difference between the structure of this soil and the structure of the beds it's very close and if we step in here we can see there is a mulch layer of Lucerne and if we dig in here you can already see it's quite soft and if we take out the soil you can see there is a lot of roots a lot of room and if you check up Wikipedia for example the definition for soil is 50 of the soil is air and this is nearly like this so you can see a lot of holes a lot of pore a lot of air pores and this is important and you can see you can really easily break it up and have a lot of room for roots to grow and and very healthy soil setting you can't smell it because it smells beautifully and that means the the better the smell is the more intense it

the typical soil that we have here in this region and it's a channel same and here you can see the top soil which is quite quite high it's about 25 30 centimeter and here is the subsoil but still people think subsoil is not important it's super important as you can see there are Roots everywhere and even if you consider this is uh is a burrow from an earthworm and it's covered with the biohumus with the casting from the earthworm so you see the different color from the subsoil which is quite bright to the dark air area where the the earthworm compost the earthworm casting is growing and here you can see such an earthworm casting which was penetrated by plant roots and you see how the plant roots develop and how they grow into the into the earthworm Birds they really enjoy this area because they find everything that they need they find more water they find more nutrients more microbes so this is really important still this soil was compacted because here this was a kind of driveway where we brought water in so we had a trailer with six eight tons and so this area is quite compacted and therefore I want to show you just nearby on the right side where we have plants grown pepper and Tahini and we had a mulch a layer of organic mulch which was a Lucerne hay or which is Lucerne hay and I want to show you the difference between the structure of this soil and the structure of the beds it's very close and if we step in here we can see there is a mulch layer of Lucerne and if we dig in here you can already see it's quite soft and if we take out the soil you can see there is a lot of roots a lot of room and if you check up Wikipedia for example the definition for soil is 50 of the soil is air and this is nearly like this so you can see a lot of holes a lot of pore a lot of air pores and this is important and you can see you can really easily break it up and have a lot of room for roots to grow and and very healthy soil setting you can't smell it because it smells

but you also protect the soil from erosion so water and wind cannot blow or wash away the soil surface the topsoil and you keep your soil moist and reduce evaporation here at vemigrant and also at the

Sarah grantes have used their own innovative ideas to improve profitability stewardship and quality of life on farms and ranches across the U.S more information at sarah.org [Music] all right from a very early age I was working in the fields with my parents my dad grew up on a farm about eight miles from here and his father was an organic farmer my grandfather kind of stayed true to organic practices and very much influenced my dad in that way everywhere you look you'll see the influence of Deborah's father and grandfather on these 75 acres of land it's called Village Acres Farm and it's known in central Pennsylvania for being a leader in sustainability today the farm is run by Deborah Brubaker and her wife Hannah Smith Brubaker Deborah's sisters Phoebe and Angela Brubaker also run a commercial flower business on the farm making this a true Family Affair we have cropland about five to seven acres of vegetable crops as well as doing pastured livestock we grow about 50 different varieties of vegetables and the breed of sheep that we raise is Shetland which is traditionally from Scotland they do a really good job in everything from weed control to returning nutrients to the soil in the early days Village Acres Farm was a place where customers could pick their own berries at other times the farm offered community supported agriculture or CSA boxes today they mostly sell their produce at local restaurants Deborah says she and her siblings were raised by parents who believes that farming was a higher calling I think it's the fusion of my dad's real interested in farming with my mom's love of birds flowers everything to really kind of create a property that really looks out for for both food for humans as well as as the natural environment that Mom and Dad really wanted it to be a place that fed other people not just food but also valuable relationships and so we've been sort of looking at how flowers are integrated the flowers bring in a new income stream and just as important they're good for the crops so we've added a lot of flowers to our farm which is great because that's a great Enterprise but at the heart of it we can grow better vegetables attracting the bees the family has made other changes to increase sustainability on the land they planted 3 000 native trees creating a buffer along the creek that buffer prevents soil from washing into the creek when it rains we want that soil to stay in the fields and so we've been working with Farmers for a couple of years now to establish trees along the creek on their Farms so that it's cleaner water when it comes our way to our farm working with other Farmers on sustainability projects is one of Hannah's Passions she has been a former leader with Ser the sustainable agriculture research and education program run by the USDA she first learned of ser when Deborah's father received a grant from them to try out Blackberry trellises on her Farm to see if the fruit would be easier to harvest that experience inspired her to get even more involved helping to oversee Sarah grants to other farmers in the Northeast who are interested in sustainability since its Beginnings in 1988 Sarah has funded close to 9 000 projects on farms Across the Nation in our area I've seen farmers use the program for everything from figuring out some new tool that's going to make their day a little bit easier to testing different varieties of vegetables and fruits that particularly with the changing climate are going to be able to produce a better product so these are paprika peppers different

Sarah is a USDA grants program for Farmers researchers and Educators since 1988 Sarah grantes have used their own innovative ideas to improve profitability stewardship and quality of life on farms and ranches across the U.S more information at sarah.org [Music] all right from a very early age I was working in the fields with my parents my dad grew up on a farm about eight miles from here and his father was an organic farmer my grandfather kind of stayed true to organic practices and very much influenced my dad in that way everywhere you look you'll see the influence of Deborah's father and grandfather on these 75 acres of land it's called Village Acres Farm and it's known in central Pennsylvania for being a leader in sustainability today the farm is run by Deborah Brubaker and her wife Hannah Smith Brubaker Deborah's sisters Phoebe and Angela Brubaker also run a commercial flower business on the farm making this a true Family Affair we have cropland about five to seven acres of vegetable crops as well as doing pastured livestock we grow about 50 different varieties of vegetables and the breed of sheep that we raise is Shetland which is traditionally from Scotland they do a really good job in everything from weed control to returning nutrients to the soil in the early days Village Acres Farm was a place where customers could pick their own berries at other times the farm offered community supported agriculture or CSA boxes today they mostly sell their produce at local restaurants Deborah says she and her siblings were raised by parents who believes that farming was a higher calling I think it's the fusion of my dad's real interested in farming with my mom's love of birds flowers everything to really kind of create a property that really looks out for for both food for humans as well as as the natural environment that Mom and Dad really wanted it to be a place that fed other people not just food but also valuable relationships and so we've been sort of looking at how flowers are integrated the flowers bring in a new income stream and just as important they're good for the crops so we've added a lot of flowers to our farm which is great because that's a great Enterprise but at the heart of it we can grow better vegetables attracting the bees the family has made other changes to increase sustainability on the land they planted 3 000 native trees creating a buffer along the creek that buffer prevents soil from washing into the creek when it rains we want that soil to stay in the fields and so we've been working with Farmers for a couple of years now to establish trees along the creek on their Farms so that it's cleaner water when it comes our way to our farm working with other Farmers on sustainability projects is one of Hannah's Passions she has been a former leader with Ser the sustainable agriculture research and education program run by the USDA she first learned of ser when Deborah's father received a grant from them to try out Blackberry trellises on her Farm to see if the fruit would be easier to harvest that experience inspired her to get even more involved helping to oversee Sarah grants to other farmers in the Northeast who are interested in sustainability since its Beginnings in 1988 Sarah has funded close to 9 000 projects on farms Across the Nation in our area I've seen farmers use the program for everything from figuring out some new tool that's going to make their day a little bit easier to testing different varieties of vegetables and fruits that particularly with the changing climate are going to be able to produce a better product so these are paprika peppers different varieties while Village Acres Farm is notable for its sustainability practices they say there's something else that

Project Sweetie Pie is a model\\xa0\\nof positive urban agriculture. It's community based.\\xa0\\xa0 It goes across generations. It's located in North\\xa0\\nMinneapolis, which is a food desert. This garden\\xa0\\xa0 supports the local community, not just with\\xa0\\nfood but also as a place to come together.\\xa0\\xa0 NRCS is supporting project sweetie pie and other\\xa0\\nPeople's Gardens with small grants that they can\\xa0\\xa0 use to expand their gardens, bring in native plants,\\xa0\\nsupport sustainability, and involve the community.\\xa0\\xa0 The Natural Resources Conservation Service is\\xa0\\npartnering with Project Sweetie Pie, and Xerxes,\\xa0\\xa0 and other community organizations like Pillsbury,\\xa0\\nto bring all of the resources needed to support\\xa0\\xa0 community gardens. We're at Oak Park. This is a farm\\xa0\\nthat is run by Pillsbury United. It's been really\\xa0\\xa0 fun partnering with Project Sweetie Pie and with\\xa0\\nthe associated partners, as well Pillsbury United\\xa0\\xa0 and Growing North. I've been out here a few times\\xa0\\nnow getting to know all the different players and\\xa0\\xa0 some of the youth. Many hands make light work and I\\xa0\\nreally love the momentum that Michael has brought\\xa0\\xa0 to this project, the attention, just the engagement\\xa0\\naround it has been really inspiring. Today we have\\xa0\\xa0 a number of groups. We have grow North Minneapolis.\\xa0\\nWe have Project Sweetie Pie, NET, which is the North\\xa0\\xa0 Side safety net. And we have the University of\\xa0\\nMinnesota, Hennepin County. There's a multitude of\\xa0\\xa0 groups, about 60 to 70 young people, most of them\\xa0\\ndoing Step Up, which is a program to the City of\\xa0\\xa0 Minneapolis for youth to get early experience in\\xa0\\nwork environments, learning professionalism, how\\xa0\\xa0 to be at a work environment, time management, just\\xa0\\nbasic little things that help to prepare them for\\xa0\\xa0 the workforce. And so we have a farm back here\\xa0\\nwhere we teach kids how to grow. So today we're\\xa0\\xa0 working at the people's Garden. We got a couple\\xa0\\ngroups out here from the community. We're just\\xa0\\xa0 gardening out here, kind of like rehabilitating the\\xa0\\nspace. We got a really strong group of kids. I've\\xa0\\xa0 been gardening for about two years now. I have\\xa0\\na background in arts and non-profit work, but I\\xa0\\xa0 wanted to re-immerse myself into the community, and\\xa0\\nto land, so I started working with Growing North\\xa0\\xa0 last year at their seed giveaway, and then the\\xa0\\nfarmers markets, and then I just came over here and\\xa0\\xa0 I started helping lead the youth. One of the first\\xa0\\nquestions I always ask young people is what would\\xa0\\xa0 you do if our Cub Foods went out of business?\\xa0\\nThere's many students that really don't know\\xa0\\xa0 where a pickle comes from.

It's good to have youth\\xa0\\nhere to be able to model the behavior we want,\\xa0\\xa0 to see, but as well, have them to learn from us and\\xa0\\nwe learn from them, because everybody's a teacher,\\xa0\\xa0 everybody's a student. So our goal is to create a\\xa0\\nhealing space for our communities, but as well, what\\xa0\\xa0 we do is we initiate leadership, so everyone gets\\xa0\\nto turn to facilitate workshops, to be the leader\\xa0\\xa0 for the day.

      "page_content=\"A lot of the other garden sites, they don't have\\xa0\\xa0 that tenure and so they haven't planted perennial\\xa0\\nspecies like fruiting shrubs or fruiting trees\\xa0\\xa0 or asparagus or any of those perennial things. So\\xa0\\nthis is also a good space to invest in perennial\\xa0\\xa0 pollinator habitat as well. This is called\\xa0\\nchokeberry or sometimes people call Aronia berry.\\xa0\\xa0 This is one of the shrubs that we planted. It has\\xa0\\nabundant spring flowers. It's in the apple family. There's a lot of different native pollinators\\xa0\\nthat'll come visit that, and then afterwards - a\\xa0\\xa0 lot of blooms - yeah, and then after it blooms and\\xa0\\nthe bees come to visit, then it creates fruit\\xa0\\xa0 that's edible. It looks like a blueberry but it's\\xa0\\nmore nutritious, but not as tasty right off the\\xa0\\xa0 plant. You usually have to process it with some a\\xa0\\nlittle bit of sugar, but it has more antioxidants.\\xa0\\xa0 So I wanted to incorporate plants that would\\xa0\\nbe beneficial to insects but also have kind of\\xa0\\xa0 cultural value as well that we could eat. All of\\xa0\\nthese rows here are the perennials? Yes, these are\\xa0\\xa0 all perennial species. There's grasses that will\\xa0\\ncreate nesting habitat for insects most of these\\xa0\\xa0 are tall grass prairie species or savannah species,\\xa0\\nthings that could tolerate a little shade. This is\\xa0\\xa0 a woody species, New Jersey tea that has edible\\xa0\\nproperties as well, but also a beautiful flower\\xa0\\xa0 that attracts a lot of different insects. There's\\xa0\\nalso a variety of perennial flowers. So we have\\xa0\\xa0 some mountain mint here. That one brings in all\\xa0\\nkinds of beneficial wasps and beneficial flies\\xa0\\xa0 and things. To keep the pollinators here on site\\xa0\\nwe bring in a variety of other flowers for them\\xa0\\xa0 to also feed on so that they can kind of maximize\\xa0\\npollinator health. Nobody wants to eat just one\\xa0\\xa0 type of flower or one type of food. It's healthier\\xa0\\nfor them if there's a variety of different flowers\\xa0\\xa0 to forage on there's some Echinacea here, there's\\xa0\\nColumbine. So I chose certain species that would\\xa0\\xa0 flower, kind of throughout the growing season, some\\xa0\\nin the spring, some in the summer, and then some in\\xa0\\xa0 the fall, species that are known host plants for\\xa0\\ninsects that we want to attract, like monarchs. Sure,\\xa0\\xa0 so there's two different species of milkweed\\xa0\\nhere. There's a milkweed right here. \\xa0\\xa0 This is Butterfly Milkweed and that could bring\\xa0\\nin monarchs to lay eggs, and then the caterpillars\\xa0\\xa0 will eat that plant. But then we also planted\\xa0\\nthings that will bloom in the fall, so that when\\xa0\\xa0 monarchs are migrating back to Mexico, they'll\\xa0\\nhave a spot here to come and nectar and refuel\\xa0\\xa0 for their long journey. So there's a variety\\xa0\\nof different things here. There's things that\\xa0\\xa0 attract really specialist bees, as well some of\\xa0\\nthese prairie clovers are really important for\\xa0\\xa0 bees that only need a specific kind of flower.\\xa0\\nThere's I read this morning 4,000 types of bees\\xa0\\xa0 in North America North. Yeah, and\\xa0\\nin Minnesota we have something around 470 and\\xa0\\xa0 counting.  Wow, different species. Yeah, some of them\\xa0\\nare tiny. Some of them are quite big, so they could\\xa0\\xa0 be nesting in this new perennial habitat as well.\\xa0\\nYeah, supporting the rest of the garden. \\xa0 Exactly, and if we can keep making little\\xa0\\npockets of native habitat like this within all\\xa0\\xa0 of our garden networks, we could be having really\\xa0\\nthriving communities of people and of all of our\\xa0\\xa0 native beneficial insects. This is so multifaceted. Not only\\xa0\\ndid you bring in some native plants and pollinator\\xa0\\xa0 supporting plants, but also you put in\\xa0\\nsome signage. All the people who come through here\\xa0\\xa0 can learn about native plants in Minnesota. Yeah,\\xa0\\nwe want to have the signage, especially\\xa0\\xa0 this year because this year those plants they may\\xa0\\nlook kind of small. They're going to spend all of\\xa0\\xa0 their energy this season putting down their roots.\\xa0\\nSome of these roots are 5 to 10 feet deep -\\xa0\\xa0 Literally. Yeah, so they're gonna\\xa0\\nnot do too much above ground this year. They're\\xa0\\xa0 mostly going to be rooting down. And next year\" metadata={'source': 'uadJyVQiVpk', 'text': \"A lot of the other garden sites, they don't have\\xa0\\xa0 that tenure and so they haven't planted perennial\\xa0\\nspecies like fruiting shrubs or fruiting trees\\xa0\\xa0 or asparagus or any of those perennial things. So\\xa0\\nthis is also a good space to invest in perennial\\xa0\\xa0 pollinator habitat as well. This is called\\xa0\\nchokeberry or sometimes people call Aronia berry.\\xa0\\xa0 This is one of the shrubs that we planted. It has\\xa0\\nabundant spring flowers. It's in the apple family. There's a lot of different native pollinators\\xa0\\nthat'll come visit that, and then afterwards - a\\xa0\\xa0 lot of blooms - yeah, and then after it blooms and\\xa0\\nthe bees come to visit, then it creates fruit\\xa0\\xa0 that's edible. It looks like a blueberry but it's\\xa0\\nmore nutritious, but not as tasty right off the\\xa0\\xa0 plant. You usually have to process it with some a\\xa0\\nlittle bit of sugar, but it has more antioxidants.\\xa0\\xa0 So I wanted to incorporate plants that would\\xa0\\nbe beneficial to insects but also have kind of\\xa0\\xa0 cultural value as well that we could eat. All of\\xa0\\nthese rows here are the perennials? Yes, these are\\xa0\\xa0 all perennial species. There's grasses that will\\xa0\\ncreate nesting habitat for insects most of these\\xa0\\xa0 are tall grass prairie species or savannah species,\\xa0\\nthings that could tolerate a little shade. This is\\xa0\\xa0 a woody species, New Jersey tea that has edible\\xa0\\nproperties as well, but also a beautiful flower\\xa0\\xa0 that attracts a lot of different insects. There's\\xa0\\nalso a variety of perennial flowers. So we have\\xa0\\xa0 some mountain mint here. That one brings in all\\xa0\\nkinds of beneficial wasps and beneficial flies\\xa0\\xa0 and things. To keep the pollinators here on site\\xa0\\nwe bring in a variety of other flowers for them\\xa0\\xa0 to also feed on so that they can kind of maximize\\xa0\\npollinator health. Nobody wants to eat just one\\xa0\\xa0 type of flower or one type of food. It's healthier\\xa0\\nfor them if there's a variety of different flowers\\xa0\\xa0 to forage on there's some Echinacea here, there's\\xa0\\nColumbine.

I don't think there's\\xa0\\nan absence of pollinator habitat in urban areas,\\xa0\\xa0 but I think we could be doing it more thoughtfully.\\xa0\\nWe could be gardening with native species rather\\xa0\\xa0 than cultivated species. Native species attract\\xa0\\ninsects that have co-evolved with them. And they\\xa0\\xa0 attract a broader diversity of insects, so that not\\xa0\\nonly helps bring in pollinators, but it also helps\\xa0\\xa0 bring in native songbirds and other wildlife\\xa0\\ninto urban spaces. So we can be adding quality\\xa0\\xa0 pollinator habitat right here amidst the vegetable\\xa0\\ngardens. It will benefit the vegetables. It'll help\\xa0\\xa0 pollinate squash.

      "page_content='We bought the land in 97. We built our\\xa0\\nhouse in 2000 and right off the get-go we decided\\xa0\\xa0 we wanted to do something to quote \"improve the\\xa0\\nland\". We\\'re 172 acres, but we\\'re actually only\\xa0\\xa0 farming on less than five acres and  we\\'re\\xa0\\nsupporting ourselves sustainably on that five\\xa0\\xa0 acre footprint. We\\'ve got an apple orchard\\xa0\\nthere that we\\'ve got about 150 apple trees\\xa0\\xa0 now. We\\'ve got the two hoop houses and we\\'re\\xa0\\ndoing it on a small area and we pretty much\\xa0\\xa0 are leaving the rest of it. We\\'re not managing\\xa0\\nit per se as a farm, more as a wildlife habitat.\\xa0\\xa0 So Jim what kind of projects have you worked with\\xa0\\nNRCS. Let\\'s see there\\'s been a number of them.\\xa0\\xa0 First of all we did a habitat restoration where\\xa0\\nwe restored all of our fields to native prairie.\\xa0\\xa0 We did a lot of tree planting. We did wetland\\xa0\\nrestoration, and that also was in collaboration\\xa0\\xa0 with Fish and Wildlife.  We\\'ve done a couple of hoop\\xa0\\nhouses, as we\\'ve lived here for a while. What we\\xa0\\xa0 wanted to do with our place kind of evolved. At\\xa0\\nfirst we just wanted to get away from the city.\\xa0\\xa0 And then eventually we were like I think we can\\xa0\\nbe farmers and be respectful of the land as well,\\xa0\\xa0 and improve it, and not just turn it into rows\\xa0\\nof corn, for example. Currently we\\'re doing this\\xa0\\xa0 golden-winged warbler project. We did a buckthorn\\xa0\\neradication project. I think those are the big ones.\\xa0\\xa0 What is the purpose of the golden-winged warbler project?\\xa0\\nUnless you have a fire or a major windstorm,\\xa0\\xa0 logging is the only other way in which forests\\xa0\\nwill go through succession, and the majority of\\xa0\\xa0 our woods were probably 40 years old or older. So\\xa0\\nwhen this program came up it made sense because\\xa0\\xa0 what it does is it creates some succession. If all\\xa0\\nof our woods and all of our neighbors woods are\\xa0\\xa0 fairly mature ,and the same age, there\\'s not as much\\xa0\\ndiversity, and to me diversity has been kind of\\xa0\\xa0 like the little key item that I try to look for in\\xa0\\nwhatever we\\'re doing out here, right. What creates\\xa0\\xa0 more diversity? Because apparently the golden-winged\\xa0\\nwarbler needs that habitat, where maybe it\\'s like\\xa0\\xa0 what five or six years old, where you\\'ve got like\\xa0\\nPoplar suckers that are growing now, that that\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 kind of their prime habitat for their nesting.\\xa0\\nNow they may move into other older parts of\\xa0\\xa0 the forest after they\\'ve hatched and fledged. But\\xa0\\nduring that period I think that\\'s important for\\xa0\\xa0 them you know, if my biology is correct. And there\\xa0\\nreally hasn\\'t been anything like that in this area.\\xa0\\xa0 So I thought this would be exciting and to see the\\xa0\\nprocess take place, even though it looks scary at\\xa0\\xa0 first when you see just all this devastation. You\\xa0\\njust have to kind of look and think, all right in\\xa0\\xa0 a year or two it\\'s not going to look anything like\\xa0\\nthis. It\\'s going to heal up, for example when we do\\xa0\\xa0 a controlled burn we may burn a 40 acre field and\\xa0\\nit\\'s all black. There\\'s like nothing out there but\\xa0\\xa0 then a week later you already see little green\\xa0\\nshoots coming up right. And then halfway through\\xa0\\xa0 the summer it looks more vigorous and more alive\\xa0\\nthan the areas that didn\\'t get burned that summer.\\xa0\\xa0 So I just look at this as part of the natural\\xa0\\nsuccession and it\\'s going to be fun watching\\xa0\\xa0 it evolve, absolutely. So how has the experience\\xa0\\nbeen with the loggers in here?  I think it\\'s been\\xa0\\xa0 pretty good. I think that our logger is a young\\xa0\\nenthusiastic guy I think he\\'s wants to do a good\\xa0\\xa0 job. Has a noise been disturbing you? \\nIt\\'s not a problem. I mean first of all it\\'s at\\xa0\\xa0 the far end of our property, but to me it\\'s just\\xa0\\nwork in progress. It\\'s not objectionable at all. How\\xa0\\xa0 long have they been working in here? Well they\\'ve\\xa0\\nbeen here I would say most of the hard winter.\\xa0\\xa0 Would you recommend doing a project to your\\xa0\\nneighbors? Definitely, I already have. Great!\\xa0\\xa0 That\\'s been already happening. When did you start\\xa0\\nthe planning process for the golden-winged warbler\\xa0\\xa0 project?

We\\'re not managing\\xa0\\nit per se as a farm, more as a wildlife habitat.\\xa0\\xa0 So Jim what kind of projects have you worked with\\xa0\\nNRCS. Let\\'s see there\\'s been a number of them.\\xa0\\xa0 First of all we did a habitat restoration where\\xa0\\nwe restored all of our fields to native prairie.\\xa0\\xa0 We did a lot of tree planting. We did wetland\\xa0\\nrestoration, and that also was in collaboration\\xa0\\xa0 with Fish and Wildlife.  We\\'ve done a couple of hoop\\xa0\\nhouses, as we\\'ve lived here for a while. What we\\xa0\\xa0 wanted to do with our place kind of evolved. At\\xa0\\nfirst we just wanted to get away from the city.\\xa0\\xa0 And then eventually we were like I think we can\\xa0\\nbe farmers and be respectful of the land as well,\\xa0\\xa0 and improve it, and not just turn it into rows\\xa0\\nof corn, for example. Currently we\\'re doing this\\xa0\\xa0 golden-winged warbler project. We did a buckthorn\\xa0\\neradication project. I think those are the big ones.\\xa0\\xa0 What is the purpose of the golden-winged warbler project?\\xa0\\nUnless you have a fire or a major windstorm,\\xa0\\xa0 logging is the only other way in which forests\\xa0\\nwill go through succession, and the majority of\\xa0\\xa0 our woods were probably 40 years old or older. So\\xa0\\nwhen this program came up it made sense because\\xa0\\xa0 what it does is it creates some succession. If all\\xa0\\nof our woods and all of our neighbors woods are\\xa0\\xa0 fairly mature ,and the same age, there\\'s not as much\\xa0\\ndiversity, and to me diversity has been kind of\\xa0\\xa0 like the little key item that I try to look for in\\xa0\\nwhatever we\\'re doing out here, right. What creates\\xa0\\xa0 more diversity? Because apparently the golden-winged\\xa0\\nwarbler needs that habitat, where maybe it\\'s like\\xa0\\xa0 what five or six years old, where you\\'ve got like\\xa0\\nPoplar suckers that are growing now, that that\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 kind of their prime habitat for their nesting.\\xa0\\nNow they may move into other older parts of\\xa0\\xa0 the forest after they\\'ve hatched and fledged. But\\xa0\\nduring that period I think that\\'s important for\\xa0\\xa0 them you know, if my biology is correct. And there\\xa0\\nreally hasn\\'t been anything like that in this area.\\xa0\\xa0 So I thought this would be exciting and to see the\\xa0\\nprocess take place, even though it looks scary at\\xa0\\xa0 first when you see just all this devastation. You\\xa0\\njust have to kind of look and think, all right in\\xa0\\xa0 a year or two it\\'s not going to look anything like\\xa0\\nthis. It\\'s going to heal up, for example when we do\\xa0\\xa0 a controlled burn we may burn a 40 acre field and\\xa0\\nit\\'s all black. There\\'s like nothing out there but\\xa0\\xa0 then a week later you already see little green\\xa0\\nshoots coming up right. And then halfway through\\xa0\\xa0 the summer it looks more vigorous and more alive\\xa0\\nthan the areas that didn\\'t get burned that summer.\\xa0\\xa0 So I just look at this as part of the natural\\xa0\\nsuccession and it\\'s going to be fun watching\\xa0\\xa0 it evolve, absolutely. So how has the experience\\xa0\\nbeen with the loggers in here?  I think it\\'s been\\xa0\\xa0 pretty good. I think that our logger is a young\\xa0\\nenthusiastic guy I think he\\'s wants to do a good\\xa0\\xa0 job. Has a noise been disturbing you? \\nIt\\'s not a problem. I mean first of all it\\'s at\\xa0\\xa0 the far end of our property, but to me it\\'s just\\xa0\\nwork in progress. It\\'s not objectionable at all. How\\xa0\\xa0 long have they been working in here? Well they\\'ve\\xa0\\nbeen here I would say most of the hard winter.\\xa0\\xa0 Would you recommend doing a project to your\\xa0\\nneighbors? Definitely, I already have.

Well\\xa0\\xa0 that\\'s one of the things about golden- winged warblers\\xa0\\nis their song is really weak.

So\\xa0\\xa0 well, that's what excites me because it's creating\\xa0\\nsome further complexity that we didn't have\\xa0\\xa0 on our property. So yeah, I mean that's one\\xa0\\nof the things that you know, the history of\\xa0\\xa0 what's happened in Minnesota has created,\\xa0\\nin many cases, a kind of simple landscape.\\xa0\\xa0 But most wildlife evolved when the landscape\\xa0\\nwas a lot more complicated. A lot of it was\\xa0\\xa0 the Native Americans used fire to manage the\\xa0\\nlandscape, and so that created disturbances\\xa0\\xa0 that the wildlife took advantage of,\\nthe ones that like that kind of habitat.\\xa0\\xa0 Well I imagine I'll be even doing some nice\\xa0\\nraspberry picking out here, probably. Oh yeah,\\xa0\\xa0 in short order. Yeah that's one thing is\\xa0\\na lot of the fruiting raspberries and other kinds\\xa0\\xa0 of shrubs and plants that fruit, they need a lot of\\xa0\\nsunlight, so they don't really grow where there's\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of shade. So that'll attract like bears and\\xa0\\nstuff like that too, that like to eat berries.\\xa0\\xa0 This particular area, the idea was to cut about\\xa0\\n85 percent of the trees to open it up enough that\\xa0\\xa0 you're getting sunlight to the ground. So you get a\\xa0\\nlot of that woody young trees and brush coming in.\\xa0\\xa0 With this particular logging operation they're\\xa0\\nwhat we call more conventional operation, where\\xa0\\xa0 they have a feller buncher that actually fells\\xa0\\nthe trees and then puts it into bunches. And then\\xa0\\xa0 there's a skidder that comes around and grabs\\xa0\\nthe bunches and hauls it to either a limber or\\xa0\\xa0 someplace where they do the limbing. Then go to the\\xa0\\nslasher where it's cut into products, it's hauled to\\xa0\\xa0 the mill. The main species that they're taking out\\xa0\\nis aspen, but also some maple and basswood. Mainly\\xa0\\xa0 the trees that are getting left are the oaks and\\xa0\\nalso some maple and basswood are getting left too. The\\xa0\\xa0 oaks especially but the maples to a lesser extent\\xa0\\nare preferable for leaf trees because they live\\xa0\\xa0 longer. A lot of people think trees live forever,\\xa0\\nbut they don't. They're living things just like\\xa0\\xa0 us. They're born and grow old and die. Aspen and\\xa0\\nbirch trees like that are quite short-lived. They\\xa0\\xa0 only live like about 70, 80 years, roughly. A lot of\\xa0\\nthese ones were going to die here anyways, whether\\xa0\\xa0 we cut them down, or not. If you leave trees like\\xa0\\nthat they have a tendency to die pretty quickly,\\xa0\\xa0 and they don't serve that purpose of those\\xa0\\nperch trees or singing trees. You want to leave\\xa0\\xa0 the longer lived species like the oak and the\\xa0\\nmaple. They're more wind firm too. They don't tend\\xa0\\xa0 to blow down as bad as some of the other trees do.\\xa0\\nEspecially in places like this where there's a lot\\xa0\\xa0 of deer. It's pretty difficult to plant trees and\\xa0\\nhave them survive long enough to get very big. So\\xa0\\xa0 it'll mostly be natural regeneration. If some areas\\xa0\\ndon't regenerate adequately then Jim will have to\\xa0\\xa0 think about doing some artificial regeneration,\\xa0\\nplanting. Well we had a fairly mature stand of\\xa0\\xa0 poplar in here. We can be pretty confident\\xa0\\nthat that's gonna - poplar or Aspen,\\xa0\\xa0 that regenerate through root suckers. So that's\\xa0\\npretty reliable. That's one of the nice things\\xa0\\xa0 about that particular species of trees is they\\xa0\\ncut the above ground part down, the below ground\\xa0\\xa0 part will sprout up new trees, so that's pretty\\xa0\\nquick and simple process with that species of\\xa0\\xa0 tree. We won't see suckers this summer will we? Oh\\xa0\\nyeah, probably within a month or two. Wow! Okay - at the\\xa0\\xa0 longest, they'll be coming up. Whatever they don't haul\\xa0\\nout of here, or whatever you don't use for firewood,\\xa0\\xa0 it'll start rotting pretty quickly and then\\xa0\\nof course the poplar sprouts will come up and\\xa0\\xa0 it'll kind of disappear into the poplar sprouts\" metadata={'source': 'Pi1Ro5w7y-o', 'text': \"Yeah there's really not much down by the ground as\\xa0\\xa0 far as biomass goes, so ground-based animals really\\xa0\\nhave a hard time finding food.

So yeah, I mean that's one\\xa0\\nof the things that you know, the history of\\xa0\\xa0 what's happened in Minnesota has created,\\xa0\\nin many cases, a kind of simple landscape.\\xa0\\xa0 But most wildlife evolved when the landscape\\xa0\\nwas a lot more complicated. A lot of it was\\xa0\\xa0 the Native Americans used fire to manage the\\xa0\\nlandscape, and so that created disturbances\\xa0\\xa0 that the wildlife took advantage of,\\nthe ones that like that kind of habitat.\\xa0\\xa0 Well I imagine I'll be even doing some nice\\xa0\\nraspberry picking out here, probably. Oh yeah,\\xa0\\xa0 in short order. Yeah that's one thing is\\xa0\\na lot of the fruiting raspberries and other kinds\\xa0\\xa0 of shrubs and plants that fruit, they need a lot of\\xa0\\nsunlight, so they don't really grow where there's\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of shade. So that'll attract like bears and\\xa0\\nstuff like that too, that like to eat berries.\\xa0\\xa0 This particular area, the idea was to cut about\\xa0\\n85 percent of the trees to open it up enough that\\xa0\\xa0 you're getting sunlight to the ground. So you get a\\xa0\\nlot of that woody young trees and brush coming in.\\xa0\\xa0 With this particular logging operation they're\\xa0\\nwhat we call more conventional operation, where\\xa0\\xa0 they have a feller buncher that actually fells\\xa0\\nthe trees and then puts it into bunches. And then\\xa0\\xa0 there's a skidder that comes around and grabs\\xa0\\nthe bunches and hauls it to either a limber or\\xa0\\xa0 someplace where they do the limbing. Then go to the\\xa0\\nslasher where it's cut into products, it's hauled to\\xa0\\xa0 the mill. The main species that they're taking out\\xa0\\nis aspen, but also some maple and basswood. Mainly\\xa0\\xa0 the trees that are getting left are the oaks and\\xa0\\nalso some maple and basswood are getting left too. The\\xa0\\xa0 oaks especially but the maples to a lesser extent\\xa0\\nare preferable for leaf trees because they live\\xa0\\xa0 longer. A lot of people think trees live forever,\\xa0\\nbut they don't. They're living things just like\\xa0\\xa0 us. They're born and grow old and die. Aspen and\\xa0\\nbirch trees like that are quite short-lived. They\\xa0\\xa0 only live like about 70, 80 years, roughly. A lot of\\xa0\\nthese ones were going to die here anyways, whether\\xa0\\xa0 we cut them down, or not. If you leave trees like\\xa0\\nthat they have a tendency to die pretty quickly,\\xa0\\xa0 and they don't serve that purpose of those\\xa0\\nperch trees or singing trees. You want to leave\\xa0\\xa0 the longer lived species like the oak and the\\xa0\\nmaple. They're more wind firm too. They don't tend\\xa0\\xa0 to blow down as bad as some of the other trees do.\\xa0\\nEspecially in places like this where there's a lot\\xa0\\xa0 of deer. It's pretty difficult to plant trees and\\xa0\\nhave them survive long enough to get very big. So\\xa0\\xa0 it'll mostly be natural regeneration. If some areas\\xa0\\ndon't regenerate adequately then Jim will have to\\xa0\\xa0 think about doing some artificial regeneration,\\xa0\\nplanting. Well we had a fairly mature stand of\\xa0\\xa0 poplar in here. We can be pretty confident\\xa0\\nthat that's gonna - poplar or Aspen,\\xa0\\xa0 that regenerate through root suckers. So that's\\xa0\\npretty reliable. That's one of the nice things\\xa0\\xa0 about that particular species of trees is they\\xa0\\ncut the above ground part down, the below ground\\xa0\\xa0 part will sprout up new trees, so that's pretty\\xa0\\nquick and simple process with that species of\\xa0\\xa0 tree. We won't see suckers this summer will we? Oh\\xa0\\nyeah, probably within a month or two. Wow! Okay - at the\\xa0\\xa0 longest, they'll be coming up. Whatever they don't haul\\xa0\\nout of here, or whatever you don't use for firewood,\\xa0\\xa0 it'll start rotting pretty quickly and then\\xa0\\nof course the poplar sprouts will come up and\\xa0\\xa0 it'll kind of disappear into the poplar sprouts\"}\n",

Birds, I think\\xa0\\nin general, are an indication of the health and\\xa0\\xa0 quality of our environment, in general. If you're\\xa0\\nnot hearing many birds, I think that's kind of\\xa0\\xa0 something that one should stop and take notice. One\\xa0\\nof the things that we've just enjoyed ever since\\xa0\\xa0 we came here was just going outside and seeing\\xa0\\nand hearing the complexity of the wildlife and\\xa0\\xa0 learning what it all is.  I mean I didn't know all\\xa0\\nthe birds. I didn't know all the tree species, but\\xa0\\xa0 getting acquainted with them and understanding the\\xa0\\ncomplexities of the relationships between them and\\xa0\\xa0 appreciating that it was just very enriching. It's\\xa0\\nwhat I enjoy doing. It's just going out and witness,\\xa0\\xa0 seeing what's taking place, and the story that\\xa0\\nit tells. Nature can probably pretty much take care\\xa0\\xa0 of itself, if you just kind of give it some very\\xa0\\ngentle guidance, if you will to let it do its own\\xa0\\xa0 thing. And I think anybody, if they're blessed to\\xa0\\nhave a piece of property, can look at it in that\\xa0\\xa0 manner and say what can I do to leave something\\xa0\\nbetter than when it was when I was here.

If other people\\xa0\\nwant to do a project like this the first thing you\\xa0\\xa0 want to do is contact your local NRCS office \\nand see if you're in the proper area. It's kind of\\xa0\\xa0 a specific area of the state, the transition area\\xa0\\nbetween that more open prairie and agricultural\\xa0\\xa0 area and the more boreal type forest, farther north\\xa0\\nand east. So there's a specific area to do that in. Although there's other kinds of habitat you can\\xa0create and other parts of the state. Most anybody that owns land, I think if you contact\\xa0your local NRCS office, or your local Soil and Water Conservation District, they can often be\\xa0a clearinghouse to let you know about different things you can do on your land or different\\xa0\\nprograms that might be available to help you out.\\xa0\\xa0 So what programs have you utilized through NRCS? We\\xa0\\ndid that EQIP program where we planted all of our\\xa0\\xa0 old fields into warm season grasses and forbs. That\\xa0\\nwas the first one so that included the fields that\\xa0\\xa0 were planted. There were trees that were planted.\\xa0\\nThat was the major one that we've done.

first thing I did when we got power was I went and bought Miss Pac-Man all right so we're going to be installing lights today and I've got the lights they've been here for almost a year and I've been waiting and waiting and waiting they were here before the shop building was ever put up they are awesome lights they are LED lights and there'll be a link down the video description for you guys their commercial lighting here is one of them right here look at that wow so this light is 30 000 lumens I have 16 of them to go in this dark dark shop let's take you around real quick before we start putting lights up my dad is on the way we have a safety issue that I have to definitely work on the safety issue is I bought a Genie Lift and we'll show you the Genie Lift in a second and I have not taken it all the way to the top the Genie Lift goes 24 feet up and the ceiling is 24 feet high you got to think about that when you put a building up this size what on Earth how on Earth do you get up there and change a light bulb you've got to have a lift you've got to have a Genie Lift of some sort or forklift of some sort to get up there and we picked up a Genie Lift you guys are going to love this let's give you a tour of what's over there so this is our solar charger Super Bass V from zendure and this is all of our battery gear and this is all of our battery gear right here and that's all of our battery gear there this is my baby this is the Unicorn Dodge this is a 2000 Dodge Ram Cummins very very nice truck got to get that out and this is the Yoda corn Toyota pickup ah let's just walk over here and take a look at the Yoda corn this is a 1988 Toyota SR5 four-wheel drive 22RE Toyota pickup it has 65 000 actual miles very very nice truck okay we're gonna go ahead and start raising up doors I got some chicken feed here for my chickens foreign I think this is where we're going to test the Genie Lift so over here the Massey's down so the Massey Ferguson 240 is down it will not start it's got a won't start issue and never trust a Massey Ferguson that doesn't leak this thing's leaking on my new floor what a bummer let's go ahead and we'll uh get this door opened up so this is a table that's going to go in the outdoor kitchen right here I've been stockpiling all this stuff so that I'll have it when it comes time to do the job this is an awesome Wolf Ridge log splitter I hear dad pulling up right now that's a catalytic converter because I got my catalytic converter stolen it's a Ford Raptor right here dad's pulling up got the Kubota RTV and these are the freezers that are going to house our fresh beef now\" metadata={'source': 'PLYhfuE2qds', 'text': \"it really makes me feel good guys we'll see you in the next video I gotta get busy this is where we'll be shooting a lot of the indoor content here on the Stoney Ridge Farm throughout the winter time so we've got a two post lift and a four post lift in here we've got some cool trucks we've got toys trucks restoration projects tools all that stuff and that's what this building is for so let me describe to you what's going to go on here in this building from this beam that way all of this will be finished this is the butcher shop area I plan to put a rail system in here where we can hang meat where we can hang a whole cow we can bring it in we'll have a big old butcher block in here three Bay sink this is going to be Josh's science project room next we have the finished portion downstairs so this downstairs area is going to serve as the Farm office will have deep freezers and stuff like that in here we'll have a wood stove we'll have a jam room place to play music then upstairs which you can't really get a picture of yet there will be a huge storage area up here of course if we're

right here so we're gonna go ahead and get the Genie Lift out you guys are gonna like this it was only 500 bucks which it cost 14 000 Bucks new so fingers crossed that it works [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's show you the 500 Genie Lift This is a 500 Genie Lift so Genie right there we got an up button down button safety button right there okay that should really be engaged uh we've got 120

electrical work on the Genie Lift today we're only installing lights now the Genie Lift goes up 24 feet and in order to raise it up that high we have to put these Outriggers on so this Outrigger basically slides right into that slot just like so all the way in right there then we crank our cranks out and that needs a little lubrication right there so let's go ahead and we'll start working on getting all the Outriggers on here and we're going to raise it up to the center in the center of the building with dad's safe hands watching if I start falling what's he gonna do he'll just be here to call 9-1-1 when they try to pluck me out of this thing guys this is called rock and roll Lube if you've never used it it's awesome stuff I'll post a link to it in the video description basically we're just gonna drizzle a little rock and roll on here and we're gonna we're gonna drizzle it on down that way too and then we're gonna crank this guy down number one done we got three more [Music] so

good [Music] high enough to break your neck it's a pucker it's a pucker Factor right there cry ing [Music] I don't like it [Applause] at all [Music] see how she goes down get used to it yeah like Dad was saying that is a pucker factor of 14 right there you're gonna have to go up and down a few times just to get my mind wrapped around being up that high when you work on roofs and stuff like that

to jiggle of wire down there Jiggle It Again it's not working this button isn't working okay dad said the wire's hot uh it'll go up but it won't go down might need to wait a second let it cool off I don't know this will get me used to being up here it goes what was that yeah okay my hat look at the red sweat ring it's not hot in here that was spooky man uh it won't go up nah I got a bad back yeah that's spooky guys all right well Dad did his job here Genie Lift is safe we'll see you in the morning when we start hanging lights we're gonna let the building air out a little bit cool off it's a little warmer up there but it's not quite that warm that was a pucker facker 14 all day so the question is posed here and I've had to put my thinking cap on that's why I took my cap off how on Earth do you take a 30 000 Lumen LED light like this and this is how they're hung I'm going to show you all that stuff here in a second but how do you position these throughout your shop building in the appropriate manner so that you have even light throughout the shop this again is a 30 000 Lumen light it's going to be all the way up at the ceiling I'll show you guys exactly how I hang them here in a second so I had to do a bit of head scratching I've got to unbox and unpackage everything so that I can go back to my table here and I can work off of it let me show you the map that I came up with and a lot of head scratching and a lot of measuring had to go into play here I actually cut a piece of cardboard to match the size of the shop building here and we're going to install these lights off of this cool map that I just drew up here told you I've been doing some figuring this piece of cardboard is to scale for the shop there are one two three 28 foot Bays lined up here one two three 28 foot base the first row of lights will be one two three lights and there will be ten feet off of this wall right here which will position us almost dead center of this garage door Bay okay this is a lot of thought going into this we're going to be 12 feet off of the side wall here so that wall there and the way we determine that is the purlins are six feet apart so we're going to go on the second purlin if we look straight up that is the second purlin okay now we look back down here at our map we're going to be approximately 15 feet to the next light 15 feet to the next light 15 feet to the next light 15 feet to the next light I have a total of 16 lights this sets me up for one two three four five times three which is a total of 15 lights in case we have a malfunction I'll have enough lights these will be virtually centered over the Middle Bay and these will kind of be slightly offset off of the Middle Bay now you have to think about this from a future standpoint I plan on having a fan here a fan in the center here and a fan in the center right here to keep air circulating up here in the hot part of the shop so we can cut down on our air conditioning bill so that is the map and that is what we're going to go off of and that is the lift and those boxes I have to undo and get everything prepared let me show you how I'm going to hang these real quick and we'll start unboxing

it down there in the comments we're going to talk about what veganism is doing and how you've been brainwashed into thinking that somehow genetically you're an herbivore and you're not an herbivore okay and animals like these cows are what builds topsoil and if we keep squandering our topsoil and keep with an energy intensive fertilizer intensive system we are going to destroy our nation and if you're vegan and if you're vegan because you don't want to harm animals you're absolutely wrong you are harming animals and you need to know about it all right folks welcome back to the Stoney Ridge Farm if this is your first time or your 50 millionth time please hit that like button subscribe the channel love to have you back here this is not an attack on your vegan lifestyle or anyone else's lifestyle this is just explaining a few facts to you about soil and about the land so my name is Josh again I am a registered nurse of 15 years I worked in intensive care unit for 13 years now I'm a full-time farmer and this is my farm when I bought this Farm we had zero topsoil on the property zero topsoil this Farm was intensively farmed and raised tobacco tobacco in case you guys don't know if you ever drive by a tobacco field there will be a tobacco plant a tobacco plant and bear sterile land all around it okay so even organic tobacco there will be bear and sterile land all the way way around it what I have learned over the past few years here on the farm is nothing is a substitute for a grazing ruminant animal as it pertains to building soil building soil life soil microbes and soil structure as well as grass crops or anything that you might consume if you're a vegan that's your choice if you're a vegetarian that's your choice but I want to explain a few things to you because if you're doing this for a chivalrous reason in other words if you're doing this because I don't want to harm those beautiful little creatures you need to understand ecology you need a lesson in ecology and I'm not here to change your mind about things but I am here to help open your eyes to the system that you're buying into and the system that you're buying into is a system of intensive crop raising it's a system of potentially tillage or no-till it's a system that doesn't typically utilize ruminant animals which built the topsoil in the Bread Basket of our nation and other countries such is the UK aren't allowing a lot of the practices that go on here in the U.S because they know it squanders the topsoil so if you don't want to be dependent on foreign food and vegetables then listen if you want our nation's topsoil to last or your kids your grandkids your great grandkids then you need to listen and you need to be thinking about this kind of thing so as you buy into your vegan lifestyle and you decide that plant protein is all that you need you need to go look in the mirror at the canine teeth that are in your head you are undeniably an omnivore and not an herbivore these are herbivores they're out there eating grass processing that grass through a chambered stomach which helps to ferment and digest the grass the cow will consume it they will burp it up they'll

topsoil there and what are we doing with it did we not learn anything from the dust bowl with tillage so let's explain this to you outside of each one of those animals comes a bit of fertilizer every single day sometimes 5 10 15 pounds of fertilizer come out of these cows every single day that fertilizer is carbon based in case you don't understand carbon is the building block of life every living thing on this planet is carbon based okay so soil is carbon based now we're not talking about carbon emissions that are in the air we're talking about carbon that's in the soil that helps to heal the

that's raised in this country is genetically modified not meaning selectively bread like this breed of Angus Cattle meaning this genetic makeup of this plant is taken into a lab and spliced in with other genes to give it certain properties such as Roundup Ready corn guys we are genetically modifying our food so that it can be sprayed with poison and fed to our food and if you don't eat animals it's still fed to you when you go in the grocery store pick up and look at the label and it has 55 different ingredients which includes corn in everything corn is severely subsidized by your tax dollars guys severely subsidized by your tax dollars now a lot of corn goes for ethanol for fuel for cleaner burning fuel that is a very chivalrous uh Enterprise right there for sure but you have to

non-GMO and seek out organic foods okay seek out non-GMO seek out organic seek out grass-fed grass-fed beef if you decide that you want to eat meat if you don't want to eat meat that's fine but let me talk about the chivalrous reason why you don't want to eat meat because these innocent animals don't need to be harmed if you think for one second that no animals are harmed in your vegan diet you are one thousand percent wrong in in the Intensive farming method everything on the land has to be destroyed everything has to be killed all of the worms all of the plants when we till we take the sun we expose the soil to the sun right what does the soil do what do those UV rays do they destroy the natural normal flora and bacteria in the soil which helps build the soil soil will build itself if we leave it alone but if we till it and turn it up what does that do it opens up a window a window of opportunity for weeds to come in then what do we do we spray those weeds okay so we kill the weeds we kill all the life that's growing and or living out in here there are rabbits all over this Farm just so you guys know there are bugs all over this Farm there are grasshoppers all over this Farm there are earthworms all over this Farm but when we spray and destroy the soil ecology we destroy all of that and a microbe is just as important as a cow okay a microbe is just as important as a cow a songbird is just as important as a cow a uh rabbit is just as important as a cow all this stuff guys you have to think about this when we've got tens of thousands of Acres being used for tillage and we're turning up the land when we could easily fence that and run ruminant animals and decrease the need for sprays decrease the need for chemical fertilizers decrease the need for more diesel fuel being burned you have to think about that so what happens is the land is tilled let's just start fresh the land is tilled the seed is planted great big old tractors come out there three four five six hundred seven hundred thousand dollar machines are out here and they're spreading seed okay so it's planting season now we plant what do we got to do plants come up we got fertilize okay so we bring

we've been duped into into watching a few Netflix documentaries and we've decided that veganism is the way to go and we feel so much better now that we're eating a plant-based diet okay okay that's great you feel better that's awesome does the soil feel better does the future of our nation feel better are you buying into an energy intensive system or are you buying into a system that's regenerative what is it that you want to do what is it that you want to do you want to save our nation's top sword do you think do you see this as an inanimate object do you live in an apartment and you see dirt as something that's a nuisance that's on your shoe when's the last time you stuck your hand in the in the soil when's the last time you planted a garden so why don't you have a few five

these are domesticated animals just like the food that you eat in your vegan world that is a domesticated plant okay I say this I want you to think about the fact that if you're vegan for the wrong reasons and you don't understand soil and you don't understand soil ecology I want you to start researching soil and what builds soil if you think that you're vegan because you want to save the world because you want to save animals you're doing it for the wrong reasons if eating a plant-based diet is what you want to do then go for it but please seek out non-GMO sustainably raised plant-based products don't buy the stuff that's made in the factory okay because look at the intensiveness of what it takes to make that food that veggie burger that's made in a factory you hear this cow that's a little bull guys I hope this helped you a little bit I hope that helped you to understand the system that you're buying into if you live in an apartment if you live in a small house there are things that you can do and you vote with your dollars every single time you buy something so buy quality go to the farmers market seek out Local Foods look for non-GMO Foods look for organic and or sustainably raised food such as the beef that we raise here on the farm we also have a garden we use manure to fertilize our garden there are no chemical fertilizers utilized in our farming practice here on the Stoney Ridge Farm if a plant is growing in the soil where it's supposed to grow if it's a weed it's a soil problem not a weed problem do you understand it's a soil ecology problem not a weed problem there's bacteria in this soil when you build the soil when the soil is right the right plants will grow guys I just wanted to talk to you a little bit about ecology and if you are a vegan good for you I'm happy for you if that's what makes you feel good but please seek out sustainable systems and understand that there is no soil ecology that's appropriate for raising and or regenerating the land better than a ruminant animal out there grazing so if you think cows are the evil that's destroying the world let me tell you something we don't have gigantic herds of Bison roaming our Great Plains anymore this is what we have we should be fencing in our cropland and running these animals instead of putting them on feedlots and pumping them full of antibiotics pumping them full of steroids pumping them full of medications we should be feeding our soil with these animals out on pasture raising them right raising them the way they should be not an energy intensive feedlot where animals are confined to a little bitty spot and if that's why you have chosen a vegan diet let me tell you that every Farm isn't like that this Farm isn't like that and you can find these Farms you can find these places you know your dentist you know your doctor why don't you know your farmer guys thanks a lot for joining me here on the Stoney Ridge Farm I just want to talk to

my goofy hat on because I don't want to get sunburnt I ain't got any hair today folks what we're going to be doing is trying out an awesome new mower with a suspension system like you've never seen so come along today we're going to be testing and trying this new Toro Z Master with my ride suspension [Music] I ain't afraid of lie times like this if you've missed my freedom I did is what you can kiss all right everybody welcome back to the Stoney Ridge Farm Channel this is the New Egg Mobile and it's awesome guys I built that the other day right off the Sawmill you got to see that video there'll be a link at the end of this video if you're into chickens if you're into farming this would be your thing so this again is another instrumental tool in managing a large property like this and this is a 60 inch cut we're going to walk all the way around and we're going to talk to you a little bit about maintenance about upkeep and about what I do to keep my mowers running smooth so this is called the Z Master 2000 and it has the Kawasaki 730v engine in it Kawasaki means quality guys it really does it has the awesome air filter system back here two inch hitch built in to the mower awesome little fit and finish stuff with Toro Toro does a great job with their fit and finish we're going to talk about this this is the my ride suspension we'll talk about that in just a second so as we walk around the machine oh pretty much you've got a belt diagram down here this is where you check your oil which is something that you definitely need to do every single time you run the mower easy access to the battery heavy duty rollover protection system right here and this is the first time this mower has ever been in the grass so I'm really excited to run it now this Kawasaki engine Powers the hydraulic motors but pushes a different kind of Tire here so this tire has a different kind of tread than you would typically expect to see on a zero turn mower this is a Turf tire but it is siped right here in other words it gets better grip okay so it gets better grip for going up and down Hills and you can't really tell but we live on a hillside right here and it's very important to be able to get up and down Hills appropriately now we have a discharge chute right here easy access for all of our belts everything we need to access right there pockets and holding areas so we have a USB charging port which is something I have not seen on a zero turn mower just yet this is a cell phone pocket easily enough this is a iPhone Pro 14 big great old big phone right here guys and it fits in there just fine the other mower I had it did not fit nice seat very comfortable fit and finish wise man this seat looks like it belongs in a Lambo super cool super nice so as we walk around a little bit more ergonomic grips that we use right here it's all about the grips it's all about being comfortable on the ride and that's where the my ride suspension comes in so you got a great old big thing here if you wanted to tote a bag of chips with you or it's a snack or something like that pack of nabs got a nice big cup holder right there if you had a griddle big tumbler you could fit it in there one of those big yeti tumblers I just use a water bottle here's where your fuel is now you have a fuel gauge which is right over here on the right hand side of the seat there's a fuel gauge right down there and you can keep an eye on your fuel that's a feature that most Zero Turn Mowers of this grade do not have is a fuel gauge so you just have to look down at a plastic tank down there

mowing done for the season right here so this is probably the fifth mow of the season but the first time I've been on this Zero Turn Mower now I'm on the my ride suspension this thing rocks back and forth It's really really comfortable uh let's just give you a little detail on that there's some shocks and springs in the suspension right here that's really important so you can Mash right there you can see this is a free floating apparatus there is the shock and a spring right there this free floats really really cool again called my ride suspension on the front you have a shock and on the rear you have a shock so shocks and springs on front and rear and you can adjust these it's just this simple you just dial it into where you want to be I've got it dialed into the number three setting it's

you can see it's got a bull nose right here and it also has a nice little spot for a step right there so that you don't scuff up your mower I will say that this Toro does a good job at helping keep their mowers looking new in other words the paint holds up better everything seems to hold up better and this mower will look like this in four years if you take good care of it now stay tuned to the

really cool they did a great job they are there's a learning curve to those tires I'll tell you that um the grass is a little bit moist the sun's getting ready to go down so the Dew is kind of coming up out of the soil and they were a little bit slick they like to spin just a little bit however if you mow slow if you slow down a little bit you didn't have any spinach but I was rolling man I don't

ride it hard and put it up wet this is a blower I simply just take the blower [Music] that's the turbo button this is a Toro blower also [Music] foreign I just give it a good blow up [Music] so every time I ride it every time I mow I give it a good one sober [Music] so every time I mow I give it a good once-over with the blower if you do that and you don't mow in the wet it will stay clean all year long and at the end of the season that's when you'll go ahead and you'll do your full on Grime and Grub clean okay do not do not do not mow wet grass don't get out in mow wet grass that clogs things up it tears things up it will tear up your mower it'll tear up your zero turn if you're riding a regular lawn tractor right now guys I posed this challenge to you go try out a zero turn mower you will not regret it there is a bit of a learning curve on a zero turn mower but I'm telling you it is a game changer it will nearly double the speed at which you mow unless you just like sitting on

a piece of property that's 150 acres like this sometimes you're at least a mile away from the barn so you've got to plan ahead and I already have my buckets sitting over here I've got a tooth bucket and I've got a smooth bucket tooth buckets for digging and working the dirt smooth bucket is for putting the gravel down all right dang it this is a gearbox transmission box it has uh oil in it it has 75 w90 gear oil I have felt a little heat in this when I've been using it and I recently serviced this machine so I want to make sure that it's full this is for drainage so we put that in the bottom to drain it all the way out this is for fillage you want to fill it up to this level right here so careful not to get any grit or dirt on this okay well oil is running out which means got plenty in there yeah there's a little over filled oil looks good fairly clean there we go [Applause] guys this is a gale rt210 has a Yanmar diesel engine this is a wooden Max awesome wood chipper skid steer wood chipper hooks up to the skid steer runs on the hydraulic system this is not something that I want to see right now does that leaves room for contaminants let me see if I can there he goes seal that guy off feeds right there so you aim that Hopper shoots out there you'll see this in a future video wood Max MX 9900 skid steer SS safety Sam don't fuss at me I always wear earplugs they're just skin colored now I know in about a week I'm gonna be over here trimming up the pasture edges with an awesome pole saw we're going to be grinding up all that debris and spitting it back into the field to help feed the land so I'm bringing the wood Max wood chipper over here and I'm going to station it in an areas that I can use it without having to haul back and forth uh over and over again we're going to leave the skid steer over here when we're done and it'll be stationed in the proper area [Music] thank you hey there folks this is Josh Stoney Ridge farmer welcome back to another gorgeous day here on the Stoney Ridge Farm this is the hottest day of the Season here and the wind is whipping it's not supposed to be this windy today you might hear it in the camera what we got to do today I've got loads of gravel three or four loads of gravel that are up here in the woods on this road that I built down through here in the winter time and in the rainy season this place is a total disaster of a mud hole I thought I was gonna fix that Disaster by filling it with this fill dirt that I have over here and I dug out basically two little ponds over there you'll see them in the Drone footage in a minute I dug holes so I'd have filled dirt so I'd be able to use fill dirt on the farm I filled this in and it turns into a sloppy slimy mud hole So today we're going to put in a culvert pipe and I think we're going to use this culvert pipe right here this is an expensive piece of pipe it's like 400 bucks 400 bucks to stop this from being a mud hole and we're going to bring bring in rock gravel probably a two thousand dollar day here on the Stoney Ridge Farm just fixing one stinking little mud hole but this buys us the opportunity to expand our road system and expand our fencing system to the other side of the farm there's about 25 acres over here that's untouched unused and it'll be used very soon for the cows Let's Get Busy hammer down get this job done guys if you have any

a good used skid steer I'm really really happy with the Gale it's got a Yanmar engine in it it's been absolutely fantastic [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] guys that kicked my butt wow what a major undertaking I had no idea that I was getting into all this I moved a lot of dirt as you can see the one pile of fill dirt is gone and about a quarter of the other pile

and it looks incredible so I'm not making videos on YouTube and as you know lots of different things going on in the background but I had to put together a very quick overview of the no dig Market Gardens here at the farm for a South Korean Network a large network of farmers and practitioners there and so I thought meswell shirt with you folks too it's a very rapid over fire of what we do to make the no dig Gardens work so hope you enjoy that okay so so welcome to Sweden this is the market Garden it's on 1 500 square meters of beds plus a big polytunnel it's a fixed polytunnel for tomatoes and a smaller tunnel for cucumbers these are movable caterpillar tunnels that we'll talk about so I'm going to tell you about how we approach no dig standardization in Market gardening and how we water what we grow how we start seeds the tools we use and dealing with post Harvest that's washing crops packing them for delivery and selling them so for context we're at 59 degrees north we actually only have three months without Frost and that can vary 20 days plus or minus every year there's a little flyover of the farm so we're also raising pastured poultry for eggs as well as meat chickens and have cows and sheep in agroforestry systems and then we have our no dig Market Garden as well this is what the farm looked like uh 10 years ago when I purchased the farm yeah it hadn't been cropped for a couple of decades and it was pretty much abandoned and so I designed up a farm based around pasture and animal crops and spent their last 10 years putting that into place and I wrote a book called regenerative agriculture which is a 750 page manual detailing my approach to small-scale farming I won't talk about this slide now but this is what regenerative agriculture means to me and this is the outcome with basically 3D printed this design onto the landscape and made a very high economy in a very short growing season at the same time but we're going to focus on the gardens what I want to do is copy nature and nature doesn't have bare soil so I've been growing no dig on no-till for over 20 years now since leaving agriculture School and the way I approach commercial no dig is to use compost beds so this is balance compost straight on top of pasture and then I bring the pathways with wood chip this is Spruce Wood that's the type of Forestry that we have in Sweden I like that because it breaks down over four or five years and worked very well as a weed suppressant and it also sucks up excess moisture and so you walk around in shoes in heavy wet weather and you don't get muddy feet and that also keeps the crops clean so we don't have to wash a lot of crops and that's very beneficial because anytime you wash crops you then have to dry them and you'll find that the shelf life the storage of that crop is not so good so this is early in the summer looking beautiful in the early morning Sunrise you can see the garden is very aesthetically pleasing and that's a happy consequence of no dig but it's also important because you can see the road on the right hand side this is where people drive into the farm it's the first thing they see so when a customer sees a vegetable garden this beautiful and this well cared for it automatically translates in their mind to everything on this Farm must be well cared for which it is but it's an it's an important selling point but it's not why we make the gardens beautiful it's just a happy consequence of good ecological practices so the soil is covered in arm and permanently by the compost layer

CO2 we want to capture carbon and lock it down in our soil carbon helps with the nutrient cycle it's the starting point of the soil food web feeding microorganisms that keep our plants healthy and it's also stopping compaction and is buffering pH and it stores water so one part sorry one particle of water can hold sorry one particle of soil humus can hold four particles of water to it it's like a sponge and so even in the heavy droughts that we had in Sweden in 2018 we could still crop with very minimal Water application up here in this extreme drought because of the amount of water held in this Rich carbon topsoil let's say we've done the same in our Fields using a key lime plow and grazing our animals in a very special timing you can look up this on my YouTube channel or in my book if you're interested to know more we won't delve into that now but this is how we started out and so we literally put old compost so you want animal bedding like animal manure like cow manure that's had straw or some other organic material for bedding in the winter that's broken down for 12 to 18 months and we literally put that straight on that grass lawn in April I think this was before the grass started growing and if you look closely at the photo you can see cardboard we've put under the pathways we didn't put that under the actual beds we put it under the pathways and in this way it makes a weed-free very nice planting surface that you can plant up immediately we've also tilled ground to take away the grass and knock it back mechanically before covering it and both work fine these are the beds on the other side of the farm just as we've put them together and this is it maturing in and you can see we've surrounded the gardens by these wind breaks vegetable crops are obviously very low so we want to create microclimate to be able to avoid strong winds that we get you can see the big wind breaks that we've put up on the farm we get very strong winds up the valley that we're Within so it's a bit of the farm yard everything is focused around a central washing and packing station behind this big oak tree so all the gardens are immediately in the vicinity of where things are harvested to washed packed stored in a chiller to go out to delivery now everything in this gun is kept in high level of order all the beds are exactly the same length 10 meters or 30 feet in our case and 75 centimeters wide and that's because most of the Innovative hand tools are designed for 75 centimeter wide beds now our beds are 10 meters because that fits the shape of the land we're working in but it could be 20 meters 30 meters it doesn't matter what's important is all the beds are the same length and that's because every time we do an operation on the farm it just streamlines all the planning and actions on the actual land for example if I want to put these row covers that increase the temperature inside those beds by three or four degrees which I use in the spring in the Autumn to help improve my climate conditions then I put one of these four millimeter metal Hoops that are one and a half meters long I have 11 of those for each 10 meter bed which means I can space them a

lumpy I'll put some new compost and plant again but the reason I'm leaving those roots is there's a huge amount of food for the soil food web that I want to stay in the bed so another way to look at this is we're not growing vegetables we're growing soil microbes that's really where I put my focus and attention I do what's best for the soil and I get healthy happy plants as a consequence I'm not putting my attention on the lettuce I'm putting my attention on the soil and the lettuces take care of themself different types of crops here and here you can see an interesting thing that we've done with the wood chip Pathways is we've inoculated them with fungi micro uh sorry not these are saprophytic fungi fungi that break down organic matter and turn it into edible proteins this is King straferia on a wine cap straferia there's also another mushroom that will an edible mushroom that will break down spruce wood chips which is uh oyster a phoenix oyster mushroom so I put down about 50 cubic meters of wood chips every five years and out of those wood chips which are not only making my garden beautiful keeping the crops clean from soils splashing back up on the crops keeping my feet dry absorbing excess moisture and when it's wet and releasing it when it's dry they can produce four to five tons of edible mushrooms in the little gaps along the edges of the pathways at the same time mushrooms are a missing piece in in the soil nutrient cycle in vegetable production so this is a neat strategy some people will use mixed broad leaf tree wood chips and that's even better for the soil but they do break down a lot faster so you have to apply them every couple of years I've simply used spruce wood chips that's a Norwegian Spruce because ninety percent of all trees in Sweden are Norwegian Spruce here's little aerial so this is uh where we have a dining space and a classroom space in the center of the yard for Education that we run and I don't know if you'll see the mouse

40 different types of crop and we sell them through an Innovative Innovative Sales method called Rico rings that are popular throughout Scandinavia and they're basically pre-sold farmers markets that run through Facebook I'll touch on that at the end of The Talk but you can see here we're doing very much what we'd call bio-intensive plantings we're armoring the soil with the compost that we've put down onto the grass and then we're planting dense plantings as dense as they can be so they cover that compost layer with their canopy so we've got soil armored by compost armored by plant canopy and

we take that out at the end of the year when the hens come out they're sold as stewing hands or a smoked chicken meat and then we dig out that material that can be 40 50 60 centimeters deep and we put it into windrows to compost it down to make beautiful compost it goes back onto the garden and then in the summer months that tunnel is turned into growing space for a thousand Tomatoes or cucumbers so there's a thousand tomato plants and in the winter it's producing us about 40 000 Euros of eggs in this space so this is what it looks like when the Tomato crop comes in and you can see that quickly turns into a huge amount of tomatoes this is the wash pack station so all crops are brought from the field using a map with the labels for each of the beds and crops are harvested according to the demand they're brought up to this wash pack station you can see here where they're washed down rinsed put into a walk-in cooler that's off to the right here and these are the delivery boxes they're a polystyrene box that we can keep vegetables cool for one or two hours to take them for delivery so when it's time for packing and delivering we bring all the crops out onto this bench and we can custom pack people's orders straight into bags inside these boxes we also delivered to some restaurants where we can just take them straight out the chiller in a delivery van and most of our crops are with the customer within 30 minutes haven't got so long to speak about this but we also grow micro greens it's the most profitable thing you can do if you have a market to sell them I won't talk about this so long but basically we soak these seeds and wash them very well for um we soaked them for about 12 hours and then rinse them really well to stop mold issues and here you can see the density I sold them at the yield I get per area how much it cost me to to raise that crop and how much I can sell it for so you can take these figures and extrapolate them for your context but we grow pea radish and sunflower like this primarily so they are soaked and stacked on compost trays and they're stacked with a weight on them to help germination for three or four days and then they're put out in sunlight and in about eight to ten days they're ready to harvest and there I just sold wholesale excuse me or direct customers in mixes like this very profitable and what comes out as a waste product is very nice for feeding our chickens some fresh greens for vitamins and minerals in the winter time when they have no pasta to be on outside so that's a quick overview of the garden and not so much time to talk about selling but there's a couple of slides here giving a summary of the gardens and microgreen Enterprises from my book so you can read that if you want to find out more it's only available direct from the farm and maybe there'll be a link somewhere if you're interested in that you can order a PDF copy or we can post them out to you direct from the farm too we did a lot of work in the beginning building up customer email lists and so we did a lot of open days where we just invited the community in and showed them around the farm and spent the whole day talking to them about the Innovative farming methods we have and that's how we built up a customer base in the beginning so we started with pre-sales and subscriptions here's a currency we developed in the early years where people could buy a meat chicken in advance and they would get one of these vouchers and then when we produced them they could swap the voucher for a chicken so it allowed us to say okay

with the labels for each of the beds and crops are harvested according to the demand they're brought up to this wash pack station you can see here where they're washed down rinsed put into a walk-in cooler that's off to the right here and these are the delivery boxes they're a polystyrene box that we can keep vegetables cool for one or two hours to take them for delivery so when it's time for packing and delivering we bring all the crops out onto this bench and we can custom pack people's orders straight into bags inside these boxes we also delivered to some restaurants where we can just take them straight out the chiller in a delivery van and most of our crops are with the customer within 30 minutes haven't got so long to speak about this but we also grow micro greens it's the most profitable thing you can do if you have a market to sell them I won't talk about this so long but basically we soak these seeds and wash them very well for um we soaked them for about 12 hours and then rinse them really well to stop mold issues and here you can see the density I sold them at the yield I get per area how much it cost me to to raise that crop and how much I can sell it for so you can take these figures and extrapolate them for your context but we grow pea radish and sunflower like this primarily so they are soaked and stacked on compost trays and they're stacked with a weight on them to help germination for three or four days and then they're put out in sunlight and in about eight to ten days they're ready to harvest and there I just sold wholesale excuse me or direct customers in mixes like this very profitable and what comes out as a waste product is very nice for feeding our chickens some fresh greens for vitamins and minerals in the winter time when they have no pasta to be on outside so that's a quick overview of the garden and not so much time to talk about selling but there's a couple of slides here giving a summary of the gardens and microgreen Enterprises from my book so you can read that if you want to find out more it's only available direct from the farm and maybe there'll be a link somewhere if you're interested in that you can order a PDF copy or we can post them out to you direct from the farm too we did a lot of work in the beginning building up customer email lists and so we did a lot of open days where we just invited the community in and showed them around the farm and spent the whole day talking to them about the Innovative farming methods we have and that's how we built up a customer base in the beginning so we started with pre-sales and subscriptions here's a currency we developed in the early years where people could buy a meat chicken in advance and they would get one of these vouchers and then when we produced them they could swap the voucher for a chicken so it allowed us to say okay 400 people want a chicken so we'll produce\"}\n",

chicken so we'll produce 500 and we'll have 100 left to sell it means we didn't over produce something we didn't have a market for because we just moved to the area and we're not familiar with the customer base same with eggs we sell subscriptions for three months you can buy one tray of 30 eggs every week and you pay for three months up in advance and that means we have a constant Supply base and we did the same with vegetables in the beginning we started with the CSA community supported agriculture where people pay you the price of a box of mixed vegetables a week for 20 weeks in our case because of the length of our growing season and so they would pay for the whole season in advance we knew how much to produce and we got the money up front to buy tools and seeds and compost Etc uh so that's a big problem with any Farm operation really is that all your costs are in the beginning and you don't get your money back till the end as it were so it's really important to to do that in the early years then we moved to buying clubs where we would turn up in different locations in towns around us for 30 minutes and people would pick up their products from there so it's very quick because a lot of farmers end up having to spend a whole day at a farmer's market not sure they're even going to sell their products and often they're perishable products like vegetables that if they can't sell they're no good afterwards so we already pre-sold our products and then turned up at drop-off points and delivered them all in 30 minutes flat so very efficient restaurants obviously another Outlet different um method of sales I don't have time to talk about that but I'll end on uh talking about Rico ring which is something you could look into online if you're interested some of my students have taken this to North America Canada South America South Africa the UK other parts of Europe it's a pre-sold Farmers Market on Facebook so you gather a bunch of producers hopefully some that are Bakers some that produce meat and charcuterie some who sell fish some who sell bread some who sell vegetables eggs Etc and then people order on the Facebook group and you bring what you've sold in the 30 to 60 Minute window and it's handy because it's people can't buy products from you there they can only pre-order online and that that helps get around some of the trading regulations so we're not a market you can't just turn up and buy things you're only collecting what you've already bought and that Facebook comment is a sales contract as it were I hope that makes sense it's isn't enough to Innovative thing that I think is worth looking into it's a new sales model that saves the farmer a lot of time which is important this is a slide from the Enterprise Matrix from my book regenerative agriculture looking at the return you get out of an Enterprise for the amount of time it takes how much does it pay you back unfortunately Market gardening is on the lower end however you see microgreens is is very high up if you live in a dense environment uh Urban environment for example microgreens can be very profitable but let's not say it's not worth doing it's more just to make people aware that there's other farming Enterprises that can give you a better income and quality of life but no dig Market gardening is a fantastic way to do things on a very small scale you only need a couple of thousand square meters to make an income and you can do it without big Investments and without a previous background in farming so I think it's a fantastic Enterprise and I hope you've got some insight from how I run my farm and after over 20 years growing vegetables I don't think there's a better way to look after soil and grow healthy Bountiful crops than by taking a no dig

formula and this is the formula size is a panic time is raking times recovery period the budget by the whole area to be great gives you that they stay your best Paddock is one your half pestic compared to one is 0.5 so if it is a half based Paddock the rating is 0.5 you are not gonna come anywhere near your recovery period so you're going to have to go back and lengthen the stay in the paddocks that are one and you're going to have to use your observation and guess how many days you're going to stay but this is a guideline and you can actually work it so when that total comes close to 35 be a 27 or 33 who cares you then start using your rated my advice to you is do not use that the rate it until you have experienced the strength give me a question yes sir so when I'm starting out the size of my device if I want to grade an area of two acres um and I want to move them forward no hang on thanks for the question use the size of the biggest headaches the fixed fences the

you live if you're living in a non-regular environment eat when it gets dry and people I'm giving you stuff that I shouldn't be giving you because it's a formula but anyway I will tell you this will help you manage so when the price goes gray because you've now gone into a drop and you monitored the rainfall you've written it on your grazing chart this is how much rain I've had we dry I can see the grass is getting gray it's not drying it's not cracked green for every week at that if your recovery period is about 30 days for every week it does not rain and one day to your recovery period and recalculate so you do all these calculations before you start praising because when you get in the gym you're not going to do the calculations if you're in a personal environment and your recovery period is around about 50 to 60 days for every week it does not rain when it is dry when the dry starts graying gray you add two days to the recovery period so if you're initial recovery period was around about 50 plus days for every week it doesn't rain you add two days to the recovery period and as you add days to the recovery period your day stay will increase in that Paddock so the principle behind the grazing is you've got food in front of you and you've got food behind you if you've got the incorrect recovery period you will end up with no food behind you and not be able to stay in a

great gives you that they stay your best Paddock is one your half pestic compared to one is 0.5 so if it is a half based Paddock the rating is 0.5 you are not gonna come anywhere near your recovery period so you're going to have to go back and lengthen the stay in the paddocks that are one and you're going to have to use your observation and guess how many days you're going to stay but this is a guideline and you can actually work it so when that total comes close to 35 be a 27 or 33 who cares you then start using your rated my advice to you is do not use that the rate it until you have

hundred years that had no genetic material brought into that Earth they are like peas on the pot and we're not talking about peas and apart people it is formed for your function and the function of those animals to reproduce grow and breathe in the environment in which they born so how do we equate this if you go and look in Africa at Impala or spring back or whatever animal they are split image of each other you cannot do that if you are getting a bull from the other side of the world but it's up to you you decide if you want bragging arts and it's important to you that you travel to Texas the Bible I don't care but remember it does help to have 200 cows so we go back to Arkansas pretty picture this was a a rice Farm he bought it to shoot duck and after five years he decided his hobby was a bit expensive they wanted to run Keller so first of all he bought cattle and then he had an inclusion Zone because the cattle hugged up the postures and when I got there this is what I saw and I said to him really you've bought the Bale Shredder your assistant goes to a church where he negotiated with the congregation he said I will mow your properties and keep them nice and tidy as long as I can have the Bales okay so for a five ten mile radius I can't remember how far around it was but he collected bows and he collected sign like five thousand dollars he put them in the shredder I suggest you do the paddocks instead of having an inclusion Zone which you destroyed and you saw it earlier on that fence line he went into these paddocks and he finished all over there was no pugging because the animals used the whole property and this is what happened in six months same property you could even see where the hay landed people and I have to show you this because I know you didn't believe me do you believe me now no probably not but I better try no fertilizer just the old bells or whatever on the ground and that's the changed animal impact energy all life needs energy the soil has been working up all that compaction the yellow flower compaction and aerobic soil gone imagine people it was magic but that nature is forgiving any more questions on comment no should we go into Central Texas unless God I grew witch and somebody he should have gazed it but he was so proud of it he wanted me to see it so he didn't rise up if you see the yellow leaves at the bottom of the plant you are wasting time and money they are not photosynthesizing please that bit should have been grazed to us already so again we come back to Greg's property and there is cattle and I think this was Judy former from correct correct where they went in and it was a cover grass pasture on the first craze of the season and there the cattle walked in and they're grazing so we looked at the animal and

peas and apart people it is formed for your function and the function of those animals to reproduce grow and breathe in the environment in which they born so how do we equate this if you go and look in Africa at Impala or spring back or whatever animal they are split image of each other you cannot do that if you are getting a bull from the other side of the world but it's up to you you decide if you want bragging arts and it's important to you that you travel to Texas the Bible I don't care but remember it does help to have 200 cows so we go back to Arkansas pretty picture this was a a rice Farm he bought it to shoot duck and after five years he decided his hobby was a bit expensive they wanted to run Keller so first of all he bought cattle and then he had an inclusion Zone because the cattle hugged up the postures and when I got there this is what I saw and I said to him really you've bought the Bale Shredder your assistant goes to a church where he negotiated with the congregation he said I will mow your properties and keep them nice and tidy as long as I can have the Bales okay so for a five ten mile radius I can't remember how far around it was but he collected bows and he collected sign like five thousand dollars he put them in the shredder I suggest you do the paddocks instead of having an inclusion Zone which you destroyed and you saw it earlier on that fence line he went into these paddocks and he finished all over there was no pugging because the animals used the whole property and this is what happened in six months same property you could even see where the hay landed people and I have to show you this because I know you didn't believe me do you believe me now no probably not but I better try no fertilizer just the old bells or whatever on the ground and that's the changed animal impact energy all life needs energy the soil has been working up all that compaction the yellow flower compaction and aerobic soil gone imagine people it was magic but that nature is forgiving any more questions on comment no should we go into Central Texas unless God I grew witch and somebody he should have gazed it but he was so proud of it he wanted me to see it so he didn't rise up if you see the yellow leaves at the bottom of the plant you are wasting time and money they are not photosynthesizing please that bit should have been grazed to us already so again we come back to Greg's property and there is cattle and I think this was Judy former from correct correct where they went in and it was a cover grass pasture on the first craze of the season and there the cattle walked in and they're grazing so we looked at the animal and this is what it was grazing oh my goodness\"}\n",

craze they wouldn't touch the Clover they ate the grass so observe try and change your habit of the coffee shop and spend that time watching the cattle and you will learn so much more so again we go into that flood legumes and the result but this is also in Greece he has been grazing in a vegetative stage for some time look at that time seeds of that I'm fat but he was Grazing In A vegetative

feed one car for one day five years later the same property change in management look at the cows I said to you that you better off with a 60 reconception rate on a thousand cars and ninety percent on 500 cars he had improved the land but he hadn't caught up with numbers of cattle look at that big fat too fat so it's easy to get 90 you just sell off cattle get fewer cattle and you'll get 20 because the energy is there energy makes that almost fat but do the calculations he's put in a watering system 2.3 million US dollars it is the equivalent of buying another six ranches he's got to stream

the water back from the rain that's him putting in and people at the top end those pipes are six inches in size 12 storage tanks automatically monitor the chairs up on his cell phone if the leaks on

have to plant feed protein sorry had protein yeah I got a little excited here so you made the comment you did not have to feed the feed protein that winter because of that but if you didn't know what that plant was how did you know because when you look at the leaf it's got a legume leaf on it and it had pods on it and they had seeds and I know that those seeds when I watched the cattle the

them there now it's an on-ground season I've got no green I've got this huge amount of grass that's going on the property because I haven't got enough livestock the dung starts getting harder and

those green cool season plants are protected by this Forest of dry grass underneath was green and I then stopped feeding protein and just grazed the cattle did better I made more money everybody's happy I'm not talking since believe it or not that all means [Laughter] guys that works I promise you I wouldn't be killing you if it didn't I don't want to lie to anybody this is from personal experience and experience in my class and I have told you nothing about what doesn't work though and this guy 20 years ago said to me never talk to me again about killing us keep trees with cattle he says it's impossible he's become a good friend of mine and the other day he sent me two photographs these two Mesquite tree has water in it and it's dark why because he has changed the fungal bacterial relationship in the soil not conducive for mosquitoes and they've got Aura in them look at this and all he said was sent me the pictures I'm sorry I didn't believe you it took 20 years so there it is the guys have been spraying Mesquite and they've killed the grass they killed life in the soil the problem is they don't change management and they're just going to grow more mistake and

bringing anything so if you the question was can you use a green brown ratio to balance the diet of the animals absolutely those cool season grasses underneath with the green are high in protein so that is the protein and the energy and then the tall grass is the oxygen and we've got a balanced diet with the green there the dam will be relatively loose good so we go whiskers and those are annual

there's the cough of one month old two three four five six seven up to the top there there is seven and we wrap around to 8 9 10 11 and at that month of the year all animals change classes costs to come here first one and stairs one if there's one become heifers two heifers two cows Etc because when they reach the anniversary they change weight and they change class and they change value so you'll see there we changing and I'll take a simple one cause at 11 months go to heifers one okay which is 12 11 12 13 14 15 16 Etc change classes changed weight changed value and so we go on and when I heifer two gets to fifty [Music] 35 months she goes to a car which then you just put Plus all animals here the change cups a cough at 11 months will then go to a half of one at 12 months and they have as one at 23 months will go to a half of two at 35 months once you go older than that into a cow you just put a plus because a car then is residual if you send it to slaughter you'll get Slaughter value for it and you whatever you even somebody else to bite for breeding will I need pay Slaughter value okay okay so now I've told you that 80 percent of the fetus growth takes place in the last few months of pregnancy I draw a red line because not only that is the fetus growth taking place in the last two months of pregnancy but the condition of that cow at carving will determine the reconception rate so we draw that red line because that red line will dictate it and indicate to me that animal performance needs to be optimal at that time so we carry on it's optimal and so we take the Bulls up so we draw a red line there and we box that area off because during that area you do not take vacations you do not leave the property because you need to make sure that that animal has enough nutrition remember I'll talk to you if you buy any open cars 90 to 99 of the time it's nutrition and not a DNA or a genetic problem with the animal the animal might be large so it takes more energy to do all these functions and that's why we tend to look for smaller animals because maintenance energy requirements are less and smaller animals than bigger animals so we go on and this is why we carve in a month and 30 days because wild animals all carve in a very short space of time so that when the Predators come along and eat the carbs which they're going to do there are so many cars that they can only take a percentage of them and a higher percentage is Left Behind because they're all coming at once but you are humans and different and you take in nature by the threat and some scientists has told you if you leave the Bulls then you'll get more cars it's potentially a lie but if you extend that orange or the bullying another 30 days all of a sudden it increases the time that you need maximum nutrition you putting yourself under stress so then you want to expose your cars to the Bulls for another 30 days and we cannot exposing the cars at 90 days and if you were to record the conception of those cars you'd find less and less cars are actually giving birth in the last 30 days and as somebody spoke earlier some people have a cut-off date and they sell those cars

better get something smart to say in that way I respect my husband he's got your microphones I mean when it's hot yeah it's been a bowl of break in July if it's 105 degrees and they're black hiding we got a problem but Folks at least we we left the bowls and I told you the wreck we had I'll never do that again but I do like the April May Kevin there's something I just got to me and I've been listening for Josh Mills win I don't know if you all caught that or not when he talked about that what's that next 30 days costing you I'm leaving your balls in for 60 days so it's that extra 30 days of camping costume you got to keep that nutrition up for 60 days instead of 30. and hit me like a stone in the back of the head while I'm doing my car darn it that's it and you know Isaac and I've been talking about this and being reconfirmed that for me we really need to be focusing on 30 days that was my question for you are you willing to well we've been talking about it I think that just pushed me over the hill right there yep oh but it's a soft pole that you can call yeah 30 at the back we just finished the background and then we'll come forward yes double that I understand it's just

work when we find that information for our ZIP code I don't think they've heard of this stuff yeah and unfortunately addictive and pulling off the pitch and his wife is withdrawn all the information on the internet so I I've got the information and when I came from the southern hemisphere to his course I had to send him my information my latitude and where I lived southern hemisphere Etc and he sent back a rating in terms of the option of getting a hundred percent reconception rate and when I needed to start carving so remember I'm in the southern hemisphere so it's the exact opposite to you and he recommended that I start carving on the 24th of December which is in the middle of summer and somebody was talking about mating In the Heat of the year so our heat of the year is on the 24th of December in the middle of our summer but you know all the relatives from all over southern Africa used to come to our place because we as Rancho Farmers don't pay for anything and they all congregated there and I thought oh we've got a social wreck here we've got a problem But ultimately it was the best thing I ever did because at that time I'd already started using my own balls and form for those functions and I did not get any caring problems because I was using my own balls there was no heterosis and I've never never looked as my Kettle carving again it just if they cough they shouldn't be alive you've got to give something to the Predators so it's simplified my life and it's worked extremely well so by carving in the middle of summer I'm now mating in the fall which is getting cooler the semen is more viable the Bulls are more active and so it goes on and I promise you they're no surf dolls in my country should be that would die I do have a question I'm gonna throw it in front of all of you for those of people that let's just say you are keeping your Bulls in for 60 90 days whatever the time period out here but your goal would be to go to a 30 day and this be I mean to keep from having a real economic wreck and let's just say you put your bowls in for 60 days only keep the ones that were first created in the first three the first cycle because otherwise you're gonna be selling a bunch of open gas you can\" metadata={'source': 'Y3fbIETZOm8', 'text': \"everybody will say that the problem for us in Missouri and everybody needs to think about this too is when do you put the bull in for that that's right that he just saw the July in August and what our experiences in Missouri has been is that the Bulls don't breathe when it's hot because you don't have a South Pole cold don't be complaining then it sounds like a competition I better get something smart to say in that way I respect my husband he's got your microphones I mean when it's hot yeah it's been a bowl of break in July if it's 105 degrees and they're black hiding we got a problem but Folks at least we we left the bowls and I told you the wreck we had I'll never do that again but I do like the April May Kevin there's something I just got to me and I've been listening for Josh Mills win I don't know if you all caught that or not when he talked about that what's that next 30 days costing you I'm leaving your balls in for 60 days so it's that extra 30 days of camping costume you got to keep that nutrition up for 60 days instead of 30. and hit me like a stone in the back of the head while I'm doing my car darn it that's it and you know Isaac and I've been talking about this and being reconfirmed that for me we really need to be focusing on 30 days that was my question for you are you willing to well we've been talking about it I think that just pushed me over the hill right there yep oh but it's a soft pole that you can call yeah 30 at the back we just finished the background and then we'll come forward yes double that I understand it's just kind of a average for the North American president is there any resource we could find that in our particular spot in North America with our local agricultural guys we even have a clue about that or work when we find that information for our ZIP code I don't think they've heard of this stuff yeah and unfortunately addictive and pulling off the pitch and his wife is withdrawn all the information on the internet so I I've got the information and when I came from the southern hemisphere to his course I had to send him my information my latitude and where I lived southern hemisphere Etc and he sent back a rating in terms of the option of getting a hundred percent reconception rate and when I needed to start carving so remember I'm in the southern hemisphere so it's the exact opposite to you and he recommended that I start carving on the 24th of December which is in the middle of summer and somebody was talking about mating In the

you're saying I'm trying to get this I'm a small operation but I don't want to have multiple herds so if I put my hole in like I plan on put level in June now we're just sitting here talking with a

check and then if everybody's pregnant then please pull back with them I mean I only have one bull I'm trying to keep from I mean most economically I'm having multiple herbs correct because I only have so much craps and trying to get onto this rotational first bite and all that stuff what do you do there is it because for me it's better to have one bird I can get the 30-day rest period easier than um Okay so you're on the right track but you're starting at the wrong end so start on the nutritional side make sure your animals have got good nutrition vegetative growth and our Rising plan on nutrition the weather's getting warmer things are happening everything is for the better you put the balls up and they could conceive in that time but don't limit yourself to 30 days out of the cold I said to you go back to your traditional lighting time and reduce it by a week a year guys it all goes back to financials do not shoot yourself in the foot because that's what everybody else is doing wanting you to shoot yourself in the foot because the unsafe if you ask me out tonight so start from the nutritional site move forward slowly have confidence in what you're doing because you're observing those cars and you can see the condition how it's going they'll be slick they'll be shiny they'll be happy because totally comfortable in the pins no walking around bellowing and being unhappy okay magic sorry I'll come back here yes sir just a quick question uh if you want to condense the time to 30 days like what you're talking about are you just you just control it by nutrition and then uh and then more Bulls I've got to repeat the question they can't hear it on the back are you controlling it by nutrition or do you put in more books no you do not need more balls a ball can

go to or is there any kind of rotation no rotation because there's so few in compared to the size of the bedding big selection not good for the soil or for the grass but for management concerns yes we rotate ours we don't we don't rotate them twice a day we just want anymore today but we have a ball here we got another Forum that we leave and that's where the ball will stay and it's worked pretty good uh they those balls living on that stockpile we took them out of the cow herb and gave them their own food in their own Patty instead of maybe chasing a couch and now they're focused on eating it really fell on some weight so yeah it cost us a little bit because then you get two herbs it's another labor source to go move those bowls but it it did grow down nice or nice yeah so you you moved the walls then yeah there's more than one way to skin a cat they're giving you tools to give you options yeah [Music] so now do you move that do you change that Paddock from year to year from you know different locations one other places [Music] you must remember I haven't got numerous Farms right I put one file one rock it might be a bit bigger but yeah any other questions one thing I'll mention about the Bulls folks is you know we used to buy bowls every year we'd go to the South Pole field day we buy a bowl we try and get the best one they had and I saw somebody and has one for sale I'd go buy it bring it home and it just seemed like the bowls that we were buying never did measure up to the bowls that were born on our farm how long does it take you to realize that we're probably three years [Music] ago it was a breaking season and we had I had big red and big nuts and they were out there and they were beautiful I'm sitting there yeah darn accident you need to sell piglets [Music] I'm not selling big nothing but that's holy memories don't you need to sell that hole and he said big nuts is a good Bowl he's got a son in the herpes as good as he is or better or he's not in good Bowl take the money Big Gus is three years old takes the money that was the name and he said you sell that boat go by three to four bread cows with that same money so now you've got seven or eight and a little set of one and he said look any big nuts are standing under the tree and all the young men are chasing them heifers they said you ever see a young man missed a chance no no probably not those Beyond Bulls are doing all the three so we sold big nuts it was so big man I didn't tell you and I did it till the next year so I sold one and it's the best thing we ever did so if you're gonna keep a Bowl past three you can expect to get less money for them because they're an older they're getting heavier thicker Elite Capital seven when we did that that bull finally his foot went out on him

gonna do that on my farm can you repeat the question right I might do that for you the question was we got Johnny or they're going to town on these Cedars matter of fact he was over there yesterday and um yeah he's really making a\" metadata={'source': 'Y3fbIETZOm8', 'text': \"and just saying load 20 25 volts but it was on the condition that when they offloaded the bullet they didn't like the ball they sent it to the slaughterhouse and Kevin fetched another one because I guarantee my balls if they didn't want the balls I don't want the ball so just send it to slaughter so the sacrificial Paddock is that just the same Paddock that they all almost go to or is there any kind of rotation no rotation because there's so few in compared to the size of the bedding big selection not good for the soil or for the grass but for management concerns yes we rotate ours we don't we don't rotate them twice a day we just want anymore today but we have a ball here we got another Forum that we leave and that's where the ball will stay and it's worked pretty good uh they those balls living on that stockpile we took them out of the cow herb and gave them their own food in their own Patty instead of maybe chasing a couch and now they're focused on eating it really fell on some weight so yeah it cost us a little bit because then you get two herbs it's another labor source to go move those bowls but it it did grow down nice or nice yeah so you you moved the walls then yeah there's more than one way to skin a cat they're giving you tools to give you options yeah [Music] so now do you move that do you change that Paddock from year to year from you know different locations one other places [Music] you must remember I haven't got numerous Farms right I put one file one rock it might be a bit bigger but yeah any other questions one thing I'll mention about the Bulls folks is you know we used to buy bowls every year we'd go to the South Pole field day we buy a bowl we try and get the best one they had and I saw somebody and has one for sale I'd go buy it bring it home and it just seemed like the bowls that we were buying never did measure up to the bowls that were born on our farm how long does it take you to realize that we're probably three years [Music] ago it was a breaking season and we had I had big red and big nuts and they were out there and they were beautiful I'm sitting there yeah darn accident you need to sell piglets [Music] I'm not selling big nothing but that's holy memories don't you need to sell that hole and he said big nuts is a good Bowl he's got a son in the herpes as good as he is or better or he's not in good Bowl take the money Big Gus is three years old takes the money that was the name and he said you sell that boat go by three to four bread cows with that same money so now you've got seven or eight and a little set of one and he said look any big nuts are standing under the tree and all the young men are chasing them heifers they said you ever see a young man missed a chance no no probably not those Beyond Bulls are doing all the three so we sold big nuts it was so big man I didn't tell you and I did it till the next year so I sold one and it's the best thing we ever did so if you're gonna keep a Bowl past three you can expect to get less money for them because they're an older they're getting heavier thicker Elite Capital seven when we did that that bull finally his foot went out on him [Music] so yeah we like using them together too and then we saw them guys that's not quite the story but I think it's time to get to the

what's the youngest what's the youngest boss we turn in um it's probably 15. 14 to 15 month old bowls a bowl is 12 even a seven month old bowl a piece he's gotta you know fill down he can get the job

guy still in farming today has had to take a few chances this story is for those of you who think no-till farming is risky business it's about Dean and Lyle mccuddin who farm near red oak in southwest Iowa in 1980 the McCune brothers switched all but 30 of their 400 acres of corn and beans to no-till their land is rollin with up to 10% slope on Marshall soils typical of Montgomery County Dean says originally they didn't really intend to plant the whole farm with no-till we were in the process of buying a new planner we'd been reading about no-till and so we kicked around the idea of buying a planner that was engineered to plant no-till and conventional so it could try a few acres of no-till if we wanted to we bought this John Deere 7000 conservation planner after we bought the planter in December we did a lot of driving a lot of reading and an awful lot of listening to fellows that had been in no-till and made it work we came home and put it all together and decided to go all no-till our banker wasn't as concerned as you might think because our planner would go either way he looked at our hotel the summer and I think he was impressed we really didn't think it was such a big gamble some people try it on 10 or 15 acres but we felt if we could make it work on 40 acres we could make it work on 400 we convinced ourselves that it was going to work we were going to do what it took to make it work I'll say this I don't think Lyle and I did anything last year that any farmer couldn't do it's not that difficult I think you've got to put yourself into the position that you're going to make it work when everyone in the county found out where we're going all no-till we knew damn well we had to make it work really though we did our homework we went to a conference in the tum WA and every bulletin we could pick up every article we could read we did any meeting on it we tried to go that's what someone going into no-till ought to do not that I think were experts after just one year if we were surprised about anything the first year it said how well everything turned out for being so new at it ma-kun's Rand yield checks on their corn and beans and the corn was about 150 bushels per acre the second-best yield Dean says he's ever had soybeans averaged 42 bushels an acre here's their system for those yields we went into no-till with the idea to do as little stirring of the soil as possible we felt like every time you turned the soil you were going to start a first crop of weeds and you'd loosen the soil for erosion that's the theory we went on it's a little tough to let your fields alone in the spring while the neighbors go into the fields I've had a few people ask if it wouldn't be alright to run a disc over the field before no-till but I think it's a mistake you just stir up weeds and you might as well go fishing I've never put in this many acres of real crop so easily we had a little of everything we had corn on corn corn on beans and corn in sawed ground we also had beans on beans and beans on corn stubble we chopped some of the stalks because they were tough and giving us some planting problems then we Harold some which is faster and I think better than chopping but you scatter meant any ears of corn in the field chopping or herring so what's really better if you don't do anything before planning that is anything but spring we put on two quarts of Lasell two quarts of blade X and a pint of paraquat plus a wetting agent where we were going to plant corn to get good chemical coverage we put on 50 gallons of water an acre with 50 pounds of

about no-till and so we kicked around the idea of buying a planner that was engineered to plant no-till and conventional so it could try a few acres of no-till if we wanted to we bought this John Deere 7000 conservation planner after we bought the planter in December we did a lot of driving a lot of reading and an awful lot of listening to fellows that had been in no-till and made it work we came home and put it all together and decided to go all no-till our banker wasn't as concerned as you might think because our planner would go either way he looked at our hotel the summer and I think he was impressed we really didn't think it was such a big gamble some people try it on 10 or 15 acres but we felt if we could make it work on 40 acres we could make it work on 400 we convinced ourselves that it was going to work we were going to do what it took to make it work I'll say this I don't think Lyle and I did anything last year that any farmer couldn't do it's not that difficult I think you've got to put yourself into the position that you're going to make it work when everyone in the county found out where we're going all no-till we knew damn well we had to make it work really though we did our homework we went to a conference in the tum WA and every bulletin we could pick up every article we could read we did any meeting on it we tried to go that's what someone going into no-till ought to do not that I think were experts after just one year if we were surprised about anything the first year it said how well everything turned out for being so new at it ma-kun's Rand yield checks on their corn and beans and the corn was about 150 bushels per acre the second-best yield Dean says he's ever had soybeans averaged 42 bushels an acre here's their system for those yields we went into no-till with the idea to do as little stirring of the soil as possible we felt like every time you turned the soil you were going to start a first crop of weeds and you'd loosen the soil for erosion that's the theory we went on it's a little tough to let your fields alone in the spring while the neighbors go into the fields I've had a few people ask if it wouldn't be alright to run a disc over the field before no-till but I think it's a mistake you just stir up weeds and you might as well go fishing I've never put in this many acres of real crop so easily we had a little of everything we had corn on corn corn on beans and corn in sawed ground we also had beans on beans and beans on corn stubble we chopped some of the stalks because they were tough and giving us some planting problems then we Harold some which is faster and I think better than chopping but you scatter meant any ears of corn in the field chopping or herring so what's really better if you don't do anything before planning that is anything but spring we put on two quarts of Lasell two quarts of blade X and a pint of paraquat plus a wetting agent where we were going to plant corn to get good chemical coverage we put on 50 gallons of water an acre with 50 pounds of pressure we used the flat fan spray\"}\n",

spacing pretty much these three spools for the vast majority of what you're going to grow will give you the gritter spacing that you need and the great part about these gritters is if you're planting and you need spacing you need set spacing for head lettuces or you need set spacing for squash then you can run this Grider over a bed and you know exactly where to plant so just going to really increase that efficiency especially if you're not planting in fabric with pre-burned holes today we're planting sweet potatoes so we need 12 inch spacing on every single one of the beds and this is going to make it go much much faster knowing exactly where we need to plant that crop right here we have the standard 2x2 spoil this is going to give you 15 inch spacing now you can run this down each side of your 30 inch bed and that would give you basically two rows with this Grider but if you just run one row down the center that's basically giving you 15 inch spacing in the middle or on the ends that is the one by two now if you come over here this is the four by four and this is going to give you six inch spacing so you know if you're wanting to do salanova or some some spring mix heads then you know exactly what your plant spacing is and you can run that fully one one trip down your 30 inch bed and you've got everything marked ready to go dip the whole transplant now this is the three by three and this is going to give you nine inches I believe and so a little bit different spacing just based upon how you want to plant your crops and this thing runs incredibly smooth this is some high quality material obviously if you do leave it out in the rain it will Rust but really simple to put together and all these spoils are just simply interchangeable all you have to do is loosen these nuts and basically from there you can loosen that out take that spoil off grab your different one set it and then you know you can loosen out each of the arms and then you attach it there on the

their winstrip trays we have multiple sizes of the wind strip trays but these things are almost indestructible obviously you know you can't run them over you actually may be able to but you know it's a really really thick plastic but in regards to a seed starting tray that will last a lifetime I would argue that they make the best trades on the market so if you don't know the wind strip tray is an air pruning tray where you can start your seeds and you can see it's got the holes in the bottom and it's also got little slits or holes on the side of these trays and what that is going to do it's going to prevent that plant from getting root bound when you're starting your seeds in the spring or as you're doing you know new succession plantings and transplants and it just makes for a really healthy start because you're getting that air printing action now the one that we use the most of is their 72 cell and we prefer just a larger cell on our farm we just want a bigger root ball for that plant to develop and grow a lot of people will go down to the 120s which is this size right here we'll start like basil and cilantro and spring onions and stuff in this now you can go up this is their 50 cell which will start tomatoes in zucchini large crops like that will start in the 50 cell winstrip tray but we love them and we get really good starts and I'll just show you here here's an example of let us start in the 72 cell so you get really good root development you get that air pruning action and so it makes us for a really healthy start now what I love about the 72 cell trays is you actually can pop it out with your finger for example when you're ready to pull your plants out instead of just pulling the top of the plant like I just did you can come in here and you can just press that plant root ball out with your finger so that's why I actually really like the 72 cell tray however they also make these dibbers never think farm tools to where when you're starting your seeds and you've got that tray full of soil you basically can come along and press that into the surface of the soil so it creates this perfect little hole for you to drop your seed into the other aspect about the 72 cell tray or any of their trades really they make these dibbers for all their trays is when you're ready to transplant for example you can come along with your tray full of plants and then flip it up and then it'll pop all those plants out of those trays so then it's just an easy grab you're not having to pull the plant by the stem and it just pops out really easily so that Dipper board acts not only is the dibber for the seed but also it'll it'll pop out these seedlings overall though I do love these trays I will say the one negative to them is they do dry out faster because you have the massive hole at the bottom and then you've got the air pruning on the sides we can have some issues sometimes with seedlings drying out and you have to really water a lot if you're growing these in a greenhouse and you're watering over top of them you really have to stay on top of it or else your seedlings will dry out again it's just something you have to pay attention to make sure you're watering a good amount but overall we absolutely love the wind trip trays they're tough you know they can be thrown around and they're not going to break and it is truly something that will last a

hands and being with my family being present in nature puts so much energy and happiness in my soul it's like this crazy smile when I'm out there doing what I love [Music] Redfern Farms is beautifully in Blue Ridge Mountains and we run a small bio-intensive microfarms about half an acre we do really intensive cropping of vegetables we run a small cut flower operation we have a small flock of Heritage breed laying hens that we rotate through pasture and we sell eggs a small apiary and we sell at a local farmers market it's about a 20 minute drive from here it's a small City Market and that's our main customer Hub is at that market so we first started that it was all all veg and Vanessa enjoyed doing it she would help me with the harvesting but she wasn't really into the growing aspect so I just started a bunch of flower seeds put them in the ground and when they bloomed she had just she took off because of that she's really kind of encouraged the expansion of the farm and kind of the flower Enterprise of red fern I've always loved flowers we had a small garden at our old house that I loved picking them and I just like seeing what goes together putting it together and making it look beautiful typically my week you know Monday through say Wednesday I'm doing seating and transplanting and kind of getting that side of it done Thursday and Friday is typically harvesting washing and packing Saturday as our market and Sunday we kind of reserve for for being together as family so I have two daughters Bailey and Avery you know I think they like it um but it's funny because there's a normalcy to them I grew up in the suburbs so for me this is like this crazy awesome experience and to them it's just life so I don't know if they get the big picture of what it

      "page_content=\"[Music] hi guys Jonathan here with Farmer's friend today we're at Bountiful blessings farm and I'm with my brother Joshua and behind us we have this trailer that's set up with a cool bot and they've set it up for their markets and CSA deliveries and such and so Josh was going to show us how they have it set up and some of the key features of that so take it away first thing this is a 14 foot um 14 foot trailer we wanted one with the side man door and we put up a divider wall to keep to keep a separate compartment in the front for our Market supplies so the main benefit that we saw of this was being able to get to Market get to our supplies set up our whole stand before we even opened the cooled part and start letting warm air into there so a couple of things we wanted to make the tables uh easily accessible is one of the first things we build a little section for that and the canopies so those are the first things to get out to be able to get the uh the market stand set up and then and then the rest comes after that and you also have the air conditioning unit in here right yeah so we when we bought the trailer we didn't feel like we wanted to cut a hole in the front or the side of the trailer to put our air conditioner unit because that um kind of sets a trailer where it's got to be we got to have that on it for the rest of the life of the trailer pretty much so one of the reasons that we wanted to have the AC unit inside as opposed to in the exterior wall was just to keep from having to cut a hole in the exterior of the trailer and give a spot for potential leakage um down the road cool I like that setup so then let's go run to the back and see the insulated setup so a couple things on the back the the doors how they are made it's one latch both doors swing open so we put a simple little latch here to keep this door closed so that we can have just half of it open and let less of our cold air out while we're loading and unloading stuff so this got insulated on the door panels uh the complete complete interior envelope and the bottom of the trailer right yeah so the whole the whole top to bottom sides and all is spray foam with about closed cell insulation about three to four inches yeah so the the nice thing about the closed cell foam is it's really solid so if you do open cell foam you'll be able to just poke your finger into it but this you can see is you know rubbing bins and stuff on it it stays really really yeah it doesn't it won't tear up nearly as easily as the open cell otherwise the yeah the interior would just tear up super quickly so with the floor we were lucky to have some of the guys that were working for Jonathan that had spray foam stuff be able to lift the trailer up and spray the underneath but I don't think that you're going to get your local you know place that you would get to spray foam it to be able to do that um so my thought for the bottom if you can't get it spray foamed would be to use the blue sheet insulation and just cut it in strips that go between the braces on the bottom of your trailer maybe stack a couple depending on the thickness that you get and attach it in there you might be able you might need to put like a a sheet of plywood or something on the bottom to hold it but there's other other ways to insulate the bottom besides getting it spray foamed which may be difficult so you were saying there's a couple things you guys want to do to improve this yeah so a couple things one thing we don't have any way to run it uh besides when when it's parked here so we'd like to get just like a silent generator build a little stand on the tongue of the trailer and be able to have that there running potentially while we're driving but at Market to

      "page_content=\"hi guys Jonathan here from Farmer's friend today we're going to show you how to install the double zipper fabric end wall and this is how it arrives at your house you don't have to have any tools to install this just make sure you have a ladder so you can get up high enough and what you hold your roof plastic down with cannot be used for the end wall plastic so you have to have two layers of plastic anchored with two separate wires the other thing that we're going to be using in this installation is some pipe and this just goes through a pocket at the bottom to give it some weight and hold it down it also makes it a lot easier when you go to roll the door up so the first step is just to open your box and we're going to lay this out flat on the ground I was able to leave it mostly folded up and I've positioned it just in front of the end bow of the tunnel and what you need to do is position it to where as you full unfold this and go up with it the side of the zipper that has the two flaps of plastic that are partly covering it here you want that to be facing out [Music] the next thing I'm going to do is slide these metal pipes into the pouches at the bottom of the door and this does not come with the kit but you can buy these separately from us and you can also buy this at a hardware store or Lowe's or Home Depot it's just chain link fence top rail I now have my ladder positioned right in the center of the tunnel and I have one piece of wire lock I'm going to grab the top edge of the door and I'm going to lift it up trying to unfold it as I go doing this with one person is a little tricky but what I'm going to try to do is just lift it up to where that pipe that I put through the bottom pocket is just about resting on the ground once I get it where it's about resting on the bottom I'm going to take my wire lock and just put a little bit in just to hold it in place and then I'm going to come back down to the ladder and try to straighten things out a little bit so you pull the corners up over the edge you can slide the excess fabric underneath the rope to hold that back a little bit and then we'll do the same on the other side [Music] so you want this pocket at the bottom to be positioned where the pipe is resting and the pocket is kind of flaring up or flaring out onto the ground and these grommets here are to where you can stake it down so it doesn't flap so you don't want it up too high or else you can't do that so just about like that I have the end wall panel where it's centered in the tunnel so what I'm going to do is wrap this around and go ahead and start a wire lock and just go up just a couple inches now I'm going to go over to the other side and do basically the same thing pulling it tight across so I want to get it at the right height on this side you don't want to pull it too tight because then you'll be putting a lot of strain on the zippers and it'll make it hard to get them open and closed but pull it tight and then kind of let off just a little bit so it has a little bit of slack and I'm going to do the same thing and I'm going to put some wire into the channel on this side [Music] exactly how it needs to be so I'll climb back up the ladder this is why I just put a couple little snaps in here and then I'm gonna lift the center of the tunnel back up so it takes the the wrinkles out there and that's perfect and I'm going to go ahead and start working my way down the right side of this tunnel this fabric is really tough so it's a little bit more challenging than regular plastic to get into the channel and wire it in but it is very possible just take your time and it will pull into the channel and hold really tight I've worked the wire from the peak all the way down the right side and you can see we've gotten the wrinkles out and it looks really good so we're going to start at the peak and go down the left side foreign now that we have it installed what

this is the first plot that we built here when we started building everything and this year this is where we grew the ginger so this was mostly full of Ginger and some peas and then after he took the ginger out we had salad in here and then now it's fennel and radish and some head lettuce as we go into winter and as you've probably heard we're next to the road so our Farm's on a pretty busy road and we're in a pretty normal country setting for this area we're in North Carolina okay this is plot three but we've got carrots and beets in here so sugar snap or sugar snacks carrots Red Ice beets and Touchstone gold beets beets are pretty cold hardy so they'll grow well into the winter for us here in this tunnel this is where we grew cucumbers this year where we did Tomatoes last year we've got celery salad these are Nancy like butter head lettuces and then napa cabbage here is platform we've got more beads sugar snap peas this actually blew over we just had the hurricane remnants come through so half of this trellis blew over but I survived the cold last night and we're going to be putting this back up tomorrow during the rain it should be fine unless I have broccoli here and more red beets one thing we figured out this year is we never really had enough succession of beets we saw a lot of them even though all this is covered there's head lettuce in here Kohlrabi this is fennel these are some radicchios we're hitting a pretty rough cold snap right now so we're just gonna leave everything covered for probably about 10 days until our lows are like above 37 degrees so here's
